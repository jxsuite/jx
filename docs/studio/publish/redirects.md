# Redirects

When a page moves, its old URL should keep working: a redirect maps the one to the other. Studio edits the whole set as a table, and checks it for the three mistakes that a redirect file cannot show you by reading it.

Open it with **Edit Redirects** from [Quick Access](/docs/studio/interface/quick-access). The table opens as a document tab, and the checks run as it opens.

## The table

Three columns, all editable:

| Column          | What it holds                                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Source**      | the path a visitor asks for: `/old-page`, or a pattern like `/blog/:slug` |
| **Destination** | where they land: another path on the site, or a full URL somewhere else   |
| **Status**      | `301`, `302`, `307`, `308`, or `200`                                      |

`301` is a permanent move and is what a new row gets. `200` is a **rewrite**: the destination's content is served at the source's URL and the address bar doesn't change.

It's a grid, so everything in **[Grid mode](/docs/studio/editing/grid)** applies here: double-click to edit, add and delete rows, select ranges, find and replace, undo, and one batched **Save** (:kbd[⌘S] / :kbd[Ctrl+S]) that writes every pending change at once. The view menu keeps saved views, column order and sorting per table.

Saving writes the `redirects` block of `project.json` as a single transaction: the same door, the same undo, and the same refusal-with-a-Problem as every other project setting. A `301` is written in the short form (`"/old-page": "/new-page"`); any other status becomes an object with its `destination` and `status`. Empty the table and the key is removed rather than left behind as `{}`.

A save is refused whole rather than half-written, so the site never ends up with some of its old URLs working. Studio checks, before it writes, that:

- every row has a source and a destination;
- every status is one of the five the column offers;
- no two rows claim the same source.

The reason stays attached to the rows that caused it, and they stay pending until you fix them.

## What Studio checks

Three checks run over the whole rule set: on open, on every save, and whenever you ask. None of them is visible by reading the file, which is why they exist. Each finding becomes a [Problem](/docs/studio/interface/problems-and-progress) grouped under **Redirects**, naming the rule and carrying a button back to the table.

- **Chain** is a rule whose destination is itself a rule: `/a → /b → /c`. It works, and it costs the visitor a second round trip. Worse, each hop is cached separately, so a correction to the last hop can sit behind a cached earlier one. The fix is to point the first rule straight at the final destination, and the Problem prints the whole path it walked.
- **Loop** means the rules come back around to a source already visited, so a request for it never reaches a page. This is the one filed as an **error**: it isn't a slow page, it's a broken one.
- **Shadow** is a rule for a path the project already has a real page at. Two hosts give two different answers and neither is what you meant by writing both: a host that serves static files before consulting `_redirects` answers with the page, so the rule never fires; meanwhile the build writes its redirect file over that page in `dist/` and warns. Remove the rule or the page.

**Validate Redirects** runs the same three checks on demand, which is what you want after fixing one. When nothing is wrong it says how many rules it checked and that it found no chains, loops or shadowed rules.

:::doc-note
A destination containing `:param` or `*` is not followed. Where it actually lands depends on the request, so calling it a chain would be a guess. Studio reports nothing about it in either direction.
:::

:::doc-warning
The shadow check needs the site's real routes. If `pages/` can't be listed, the run says so and reports **chains and loops only**, because reporting a clean bill from a short route list would make every shadowed rule look fine.

## Import an existing set

**Import Redirects…** opens a paste box that takes either format:

- a Netlify/Cloudflare **`_redirects`** file: `source destination [status]`, one rule per line, `#` comments and blank lines skipped, and a forcing `!` after the status tolerated;
- **CSV** with a `source,destination,status` header. The source column also answers to `from`, `old` or `path`; the destination column to `to`, `new` or `target`; the status column to `code`. With no recognizable header, the first three columns are read positionally, which is what makes a two-column paste out of a spreadsheet work.

Studio picks the reader by looking for a comma on the first line that isn't blank or a comment, and tells you which one ran, because that guess can be wrong.

Imported rows are **staged, not written**. They arrive as pending rows in the table for you to read before you save, because an import is the one set of redirects nobody has gone through line by line. Two things are never silent:

- a source the table already holds is skipped, and named;
- a line that couldn't be read is listed with its line number.

:::doc-tip
The [AI assistant](/docs/studio/ai/chat) can run the check for you: **Validate Redirects** is one of its tools, and the findings come back to it as data as well as being filed under **Redirects** in the Problems tab. Opening the table and importing a paste stay yours: both are surfaces for a person, so the assistant is not offered them.

- **[Redirects](/docs/framework/site/redirects)** covers what the build emits from these rules, and how each host reads it.
- **[Routing](/docs/framework/site/routing)** explains how real pages claim their URLs, which is what a shadow collides with.
- **[Publish](/docs/studio/publish)** gets the change live.
