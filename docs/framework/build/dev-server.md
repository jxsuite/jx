# The dev server

During development you don't run the compiled `dist/` output. You run your source files through the Jx dev server, a Bun-native server from `@jxsuite/server`. It serves the project directory as-is, reloads the browser when files change, executes server-side code on your behalf, and backs Studio's file operations.

## Starting it

The whole server is one call, `createDevServer`:

```js
// server.js
import { createDevServer } from "@jxsuite/server";

await createDevServer({
  root: import.meta.dir,
  port: 3000,
});
```

Run it with `bun run server.js` and open `http://localhost:3000/`. The full options surface:

| Option       | Default    | What it does                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `root`       | (required) | Project root to serve; every file operation is contained to it.                                                                                  |
| `port`       | `3000`     | Listen port.                                                                                                                                     |
| `builds`     | `[]`       | `Bun.build` entries (`entrypoints`, `outdir`, optional `match`, `label`) bundled at startup and selectively rebuilt when a changed file matches. |
| `watch`      | `true`     | File watching + live reload. Pass `false` to disable, or an options object for the watcher.                                                      |
| `studio`     | `true`     | Mounts the `/__studio/*` API that Jx Studio talks to.                                                                                            |
| `middleware` | —          | Your own routes as `(req, url) => Response \| null`, checked before static file serving.                                                         |

:::doc-note
For a site project, [`jx dev`](/docs/framework/build/cli) is the front door: it runs this server under Bun with a site-aware wrapper that builds the project up front, serves the built pages from `dist/`, and rebuilds before each live-reload broadcast. A hand-written `server.js` like the one above is for embedding the server with custom options.
:::

## Live reload

The server watches `root` (ignoring `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.git/`, and friends) and exposes a Server-Sent Events endpoint at `/__reload`. Every `.html` file it serves gets a one-line client injected before `</body>`:

```html
<script>
  new EventSource("/__reload").onmessage = () => location.reload();
</script>
```

Save a file and every connected page reloads. When the changed file matches a `builds` entry's `match` pattern, that bundle is rebuilt first, so the reload picks up fresh output. The one exception is the Studio editor itself: Studio pages never get the reload script, because Studio refreshes edited files in place and a full reload would discard open tabs and undo history.

### What the watcher skips

Beyond the ignored directory names, two kinds of entry are skipped whatever they are called:

- **Anything that is not a directory or a regular file**: unix sockets, FIFOs and device nodes. The operating system refuses to watch them, and a project directory that happens to hold one (a running agent's socket, say) would otherwise take the watcher down with it.
- **Symlinks pointing outside the project.** A link that resolves back inside `root` is ordinary project content and its changes reload the page as usual. One that resolves outside is left alone, so the watcher stays inside the directory you pointed it at instead of following a link into the rest of the disk.

:::doc-tip
Set `watch.ignore` for names you want skipped: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, build caches. The two rules above are not configurable; they are what keeps a watch of one directory a watch of one directory.
:::

### Restarting the server

Restart the dev server and the page reconnects in about half a second, then reloads once, so a save made during the restart still lands. Without that, the browser's own reconnection delay is measured in seconds, which is long enough for the save to look like it did nothing.

You get exactly one reload no matter how many changes happened while the connection was down. That's deliberate: the page in front of you was built before the disconnect, and one full reload already covers everything you missed.

## How Studio is served

Studio is a static web app plus a REST API, and the dev server provides both. With `studio: true` (the default), the server mounts `/__studio/*`: project metadata, file listing, read/write/delete/rename, component discovery, content search, code formatting and linting for the function-body editor, and a realtime co-editing WebSocket at `/__studio/collab`. Every filesystem operation is validated to stay under `root`, so path traversal is rejected.

The two meet at renames. A co-editing room is keyed by path, so renaming a file (which is also what [converting one to another format](/docs/studio/interface#converting-a-file-to-another-format) does) drops the room for the old path. Without that the room would outlive the move holding the file's old content, and the flush the server runs when it shuts down would write that content back, recreating the file the rename deleted.

Studio's UI assets are ordinary static files under the served root; opening a project in Studio activates its directory on the server, which then also resolves project files, and `public/` contents at the site root, exactly as the production build would. The desktop app doesn't use this server (it embeds its own loopback-only, token-gated variant), but it speaks the same API.

## Running server-side code: the two proxies

Production builds compile server-side work into generated handlers. In development there is no build, so the runtime hands that work to the dev server through two POST endpoints. You don't call either one yourself. They exist so documents behave the same in dev as after `jx build`.

### Module resolution (`POST /__jx_resolve__`)

When a document uses an external class (a `$prototype` entry with a `$src`), the browser can't always resolve it: the module may need Node-only APIs like the filesystem, or live behind CORS. The runtime posts the entry (its `$src`, `$prototype`, `$export`, and config) to the dev server, which imports the module server-side (`.js` directly, `.class.json` via its `$implementation`), instantiates the class with the config, resolves it, and returns the value as JSON. Reactive entries re-resolve when their inputs change.

### Server functions (`POST /__jx_server__`)

Functions marked `timing: "server"` never ship to the browser. In development the runtime posts the call instead:

```json
{
  "$src": "./dashboard.server.js",
  "$export": "fetchMetrics",
  "arguments": { "userId": 42 }
}
```

The server imports the module, invokes the export with the arguments object, and returns the result as JSON. In production the same calls hit the generated server handler (see [How compilation works](/docs/framework/build)).

Extensions that declare server mounts (for example the data API) are served under `/_jx/*` with the same wire contract as the generated production worker, so data-backed documents work identically in both environments.

## Static files and npm packages

Anything the other routes don't claim is served from disk: files under `root` at their natural URLs, then files under the active Studio project, then the project's `public/` directory mapped to the site root, mirroring where assets live in production. Bare npm specifiers in URLs (such as `@jxsuite/parser/…`) are resolved through `node_modules`, bundled on demand with `Bun.build`, and cached for the life of the server. All responses are sent with `Cache-Control: no-cache` so a plain reload never serves a stale bundle.

Content types come from Bun's own inference, with two corrections: a `.md` file is sent as `text/markdown; variant=GFM` (bare `text/markdown` doesn't say which markdown), and a `.yaml` file as `application/yaml` rather than the deprecated `text/yaml`. Every other extension keeps the inferred type.

## The live site preview

Studio's **Open in Browser** doesn't compile anything. It asks this server to stand up a second loopback address, one per project, that serves your working tree as a site: each page is composed as it's asked for, at the route it will really have, and assembled in the reader's browser by `@jxsuite/runtime`. That's why it opens at once and why it can show you the document you're editing rather than the last one you saved, which is the whole point of it. Studio sends the unsaved bytes over and this server prefers them over the file at every read.

The address is separate from this one on purpose, and not because the paths would clash. A browser tab belongs to a _project_, and this server belongs to a _window_: a tab pointed here would die with the window that opened it. The other reason is that a previewed page runs your project's own JavaScript, and giving it an origin of its own keeps it away from anything the editor keeps in the browser. What it will serve is an allowlist that defaults closed, so `project.json`, a lockfile and every dotfile are unreachable from a page.

Your own components render without being listed anywhere. The preview walks the page it composed, finds the tags your `components/` directory defines, and registers those, following each component into the components it uses in turn. You only need `$elements` for what your project does not define, such as a component from an npm package.

Markdown pages preview too, and so does anything else one of your extensions can parse. The preview reads the `extensions` list in your `project.json` and builds the same format registry a build does, so `pages/index.md` renders here the way it will in production. It reads that file the same way it reads the rest of your tree, unsaved bytes first, so adding an extension in Studio takes effect on the next reload rather than after a save. A page whose format nothing installed can parse says so by name instead of rendering blank.

It reloads the same way this server does, over the same stream, and one save is one reload however many things it changed. Press **Open in Browser** again and you get the same tab, moved to whatever page you're on now.
