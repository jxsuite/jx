# CLI commands

Jx has two command-line surfaces: `bun create @jxsuite`, which scaffolds a new project once, and the `jx` CLI, which ships with `@jxsuite/compiler` (a devDependency of every scaffolded project) and operates on an existing project. Every `jx` command takes an optional project root as its first positional argument and defaults to the current directory.

## `bun create @jxsuite`

Scaffold a new Jx project.

```bash
bun create @jxsuite <directory> [--template <id>]
```

| Flag              | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--template <id>` | Skip the template prompt. Accepts a built-in template id (`blank`, `desktop-first`, `mobile-first`, `mobile-app`) or a starter id; built-in ids win over starter ids, and an unknown id falls back to `blank`. |

The scaffolder then prompts for a project name, description, production URL, a template (when `--template` wasn't given, from the built-in variants plus the starter sites), and a deployment adapter: `static` (default), `cloudflare-pages`, `node`, `bun`, or `cloudflare-workers`.

A blank scaffold produces:

- `project.json`: bound to `./project.schema.json`, with a viewport `$head`, `$media` breakpoints matching the template (desktop-first `max-width` queries or mobile-first `min-width` queries), a `build` block (`outDir: "./dist"`, `format: "directory"`, `trailingSlash: "always"`, plus `adapter` when not static), `extensions: ["@jxsuite/parser"]`, an empty `content` section, base `style`, and `defaults` pointing at `./layouts/base.json`
- `package.json`: `@jxsuite/parser` as a dependency, `@jxsuite/compiler` and `@jxsuite/runtime` as devDependencies, and `build`/`dev` scripts (plus a `deploy` script and `wrangler` for the Cloudflare adapters)
- `layouts/base.json`, `pages/index.md`, empty `components/`, `content/`, and `public/` directories, and a `.gitignore`
- `wrangler.jsonc` for the Cloudflare adapters; the `mobile-app` template overlays an app-shell layout and home page

Choosing a starter instead copies the starter site verbatim (minus build artifacts), then re-stamps `project.json` with your name, URL, description, and adapter, and rebuilds `package.json` with current dependency ranges.

The new project is always writable, whatever permissions the templates themselves carry. Templates are copied from wherever `@jxsuite/create` and `@jxsuite/starters` are installed, and a read-only install (every path under `/nix/store` is read-only by construction) would otherwise hand you a project you could not edit, install into, or build.

A scaffold that fails partway cleans up after itself, so a retry sees the destination it expects rather than the debris of the previous attempt. Only what the scaffolder wrote is removed: a directory it created is deleted, a directory that already existed is emptied, and a destination that already had content is refused before anything is written at all.

## `jx build`

Build the site to the configured `outDir` (default `dist/`). See [How compilation works](/docs/framework/build) for what happens inside.

```bash
jx build [root] [--verbose] [--no-clean]
```

| Flag         | What it does                             |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `--verbose`  | Print detailed build progress.           |
| `--no-clean` | Don't remove the output directory first. |

Prints a summary (`Done: 12 routes → 34 files`) on success; lists route errors and exits `1` if any page failed to compile.

## `jx dev`

Start the dev server for a project: builds the site, serves the built pages with live reload (edits rebuild before the browser refreshes), and exposes the Studio backend API. Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) and `@jxsuite/server` in the project's devDependencies, both part of every scaffolded project; `jx dev` prints an install hint when either is missing.

```bash
jx dev [root] [--port <n>]
```

| Flag         | What it does                        |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `--port <n>` | Port to listen on (default `3000`). |

See [The dev server](/docs/framework/build/dev-server) for what runs underneath.

## `jx preview`

Serve an already-built `dist/` directory, a dependency-free static server for checking the production build locally. Run `jx build` first.

```bash
jx preview [root] [--port <n>]
```

| Flag         | What it does                        |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `--port <n>` | Port to listen on (default `4173`). |

Directory URLs map to their `index.html` (with or without a trailing slash) and `404.html` is served for missing routes when present.

## `jx schema`

Generate the project's JSON Schema entry documents, `project.schema.json` and `document.schema.json`, by composing the core schemas with the fragments shipped by each extension in `project.json`'s `extensions`. The outputs are written into the project root as committed, **self-contained** artifacts: the core and fragment resources are embedded under `$defs` keyed by their canonical `$id`s, so editors resolve them offline with no `node_modules`, network, or editor configuration. No flags.

```bash
jx schema [root]
```

Re-run it whenever you change the `extensions` list so editors and `jx validate` see the current schema.

## `jx validate`

Validate the whole project tree (run `jx schema` first). One flag.

```bash
jx validate [root] [--strict]
```

Checks, in order: that both committed entry documents are self-contained (every `$ref` a root-relative JSON Pointer that resolves in the same file, and if one does not, it asks you to regenerate with `jx schema` and stops there, since the remaining checks compile those files); `project.json` against the generated `project.schema.json`; every document under `components/`, `pages/`, and `layouts/` against the bundled document schema; every project-local `*.class.json` against the class schema; and each enabled extension's schema fragments compile standalone.

Prints `Project is valid (N files checked)` on success; otherwise lists each file's violations with their instance paths and exits `1`.

After the schema checks, every well-formed document is also judged by the popover, dialog and [accessibility](/docs/framework/concepts/accessibility) rules. Their findings print beside the verdict, one per line as `file: severity: message [source/rule, WCAG n]`, and they are advisory: a well-formed project stays valid. Pass `--strict` to fail the run, and exit `1`, on a lint error. A warning never fails it.

:::doc-note
`jx validate` never writes. If an entry document is older than `project.json` it composes a current one in memory for the duration of the run and leaves the committed file exactly as it is. Run `jx schema` when you want the file itself updated. A checker that edits what it is checking can report green on bytes it just wrote.
:::

The output shape is meant to be read by whatever wrote the file, a person or a generator: one line naming the file, then one `- <instance path>: <message>` line per violation. Paired with the non-zero exit it drops straight into a write-check-fix loop. Because `jx schema` embeds every core and fragment resource under `$defs` keyed by its canonical `$id`, the document checks resolve from the committed entry documents alone (no network fetch, no module resolution), so an editor's inline squiggles and this command are looking at exactly the same schema.

## `jx db push`

Additively sync the tables declared in `project.json`'s `data` section to their `connections` databases, through each connection's connector. Credentials come from the environment merged with the project's `.dev.vars` file. After a real (non-dry-run) apply, each connector's binding fragments are merged into `wrangler.jsonc`, preserving your keys.

```bash
jx db push [root] [--dry-run] [--connection <name>]
```

| Flag                  | What it does                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `--dry-run`           | Print the SQL statements without executing them. |
| `--connection <name>` | Restrict the push to one `connections` entry.    |

The sync is additive-only: it creates missing tables and columns and never drops or rewrites existing ones. Per-connection output lists the tables, statements, and warnings; a missing `connections` section or an unknown connection name is an error.

The CLI talks to each connection exactly as declared: a `d1` connection reaches the real D1 database (through its binding, or the D1 HTTP API with `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` plus the account and database ids). Studio's **Push Schema** button runs through the dev server, which substitutes a local stand-in for any provider that declares one, so a D1 connection pushed from Studio lands in `.jx/data/<connection>.sqlite`, while the same connection pushed from a terminal lands in D1 itself.

:::doc-warning
`jx db push` covers the `data` section only. The auth extension's account tables (`user`, `session`, `account`, `verification`) come from a separate push step that Studio's **Push Schema** button and the dev server run, and the dev server also creates them on its first request to `/_jx/auth`. The CLI push does not include them today. A database whose schema only ever came from `jx db push` has no account tables, and sign-in fails against it at runtime.
