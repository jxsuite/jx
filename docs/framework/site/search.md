# Site search

Jx sites get full-text search from the `@jxsuite/search` extension: the build emits a JSON index from your content collections, and a small headless client (MiniSearch under the hood, ~21 kB minified) answers queries entirely in the browser. No server and no third-party service: results work on any static host, and section matches deep-link straight to the heading (`/docs/framework/site/#assets`).

## Enabling the section

Add the extension and a `search` section to `project.json`, then regenerate schemas with `jx schema`:

```json
{
  "extensions": ["@jxsuite/parser", "@jxsuite/search"],
  "search": {
    "collections": {
      "docs": { "basePath": "/docs/", "boost": { "title": 4, "heading": 2 } }
    }
  }
}
```

Per collection:

| Key            | Default                        | Meaning                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `basePath`     | _(required)_                   | URL prefix mapping entry ids to routes                         |
| `fields`       | `["title", "heading", "text"]` | Document fields the index searches                             |
| `boost`        | `{}`                           | Per-field score boosts                                         |
| `sections`     | `true`                         | Also index one document per heading, with `#anchor` deep links |
| `sectionDepth` | `3`                            | Deepest heading level that gets its own section document       |

Top-level: `output` (default `/search-index.json`) sets where the index is written; `engine` is `minisearch` (the only engine today; the field exists so future engines slot in without reshaping the section).

`bunx jx build` then emits the index into `dist/` alongside your pages. The index holds two kinds of documents per entry: the whole page, and one per heading section, so a query can land on "the _Assets_ section of _Site architecture_" rather than just the page.

With `sections` on, the page document carries only the text **before** the first heading. The sections cover the rest, and storing both put the entire corpus in the index twice, doubling the download and the work the browser does to index it. Nothing becomes unsearchable: a body-text match now surfaces the section that contains it, deep-linked, instead of competing with it. An entry with no headings keeps its full text, because nothing else would index it.

Set `sections: false` for a collection whose entries are short enough that a deep link adds nothing; the page documents then carry their full text again.

To keep one entry out of the index, put `search: false` in its frontmatter. The entry then contributes no documents at all, page or sections, and nothing else about it changes: it still builds and still routes. Only the boolean opts out; a value such as `"false"` is indexed and the build warns about it once. Use it for a page worth publishing but not worth finding, such as a generated changelog.

## Querying from page state

The `Search` prototype gives any page reactive results with zero client wiring:

```json
"state": {
  "q": "",
  "results": { "$prototype": "Search", "query": { "$ref": "#/state/q" }, "limit": 8 }
}
```

Bind an input to `state.q` and map over `state.results`. Each result group is a page with its matching sections:

```json
{
  "slug": "framework/site",
  "title": "Site architecture",
  "url": "/docs/framework/site/",
  "score": 12.4,
  "hits": [{ "heading": "Assets", "url": "/docs/framework/site/#assets", "score": 9.1 }]
}
```

In compiled sites the def lowers to plain client code that lazily loads the bundled client and fetches the index on first use, so nothing is downloaded until the visitor actually searches. Options: `limit` (max rows, default 8), `group` (set `false` for the flat row list described below), `index` (override the index URL), `locale` (see below).

### On a multilingual site

A collection kept [one directory per locale](/docs/framework/site/i18n#content-in-one-directory-per-locale) is indexed once per language, and the search box **searches the page's own language** with no configuration, because it reads `<html lang>`, which the build wrote from the route's locale. Results link into that language's URL space.

Set `locale` to override it: a tag to search one named language, or `null` to search every one.

:::doc-note
Without that default, a reader searching a French page would be handed the English copy of the page they're already on, ranked first because it matched the same words.

## Building a search UI component

Interactive components aren't lowered, so inside a compiled component you use the headless client directly through its `$src` state conventions, where the export names double as state keys:

```json
"state": {
  "searchQuery": "",
  "searchResults": [],
  "searchReady": false,
  "searchActive": 0,
  "searchInit": { "$prototype": "Function", "$src": "npm:@jxsuite/search/client", "$lazy": true, "parameters": ["state"] },
  "runSearch": { "$prototype": "Function", "$src": "npm:@jxsuite/search/client", "$lazy": true, "parameters": ["state", "e"] },
  "onMount": { "$prototype": "Function", "arguments": ["state"], "body": "state.searchInit(state);" }
}
```

- `searchInit(state)` preloads the index and flips `state.searchReady` (re-running any pending query).
- `runSearch(state, e)` reads the input event, stores flat rows on `state.searchResults`, publishes the row count as `state.searchCount`, and resets `state.searchActive`. Wire it to your input's `oninput`.

The build bundles `npm:@jxsuite/search/client` (MiniSearch included) into `/assets/` automatically. Declare the dependency in your project's `package.json` and import it like any module.

:::doc-tip
`"$lazy": true` is doing real work here. Without it the client is a static import, so every page that renders the component downloads, parses and evaluates MiniSearch whether or not anybody searches. With it, all three happen on the first call.

Call `searchInit` when search is **opened**, not on mount. Warming the index ahead of time sounds free and is not: fetching and indexing a whole corpus is the single most expensive thing the page does, and doing it during load competes with the paint. The client handles being queried before it is ready (`query()` returns no rows and starts the load, and `searchInit` re-runs the pending query when it finishes), so booting on open costs the visitor nothing they notice.
:::

For full control, import the core API from the same module: `preload(indexUrl?)`, `isReady()`, and the synchronous `query(text, { limit, group, pageCap })`.

## Rendering a result row

Flat rows (`group: false`, what `runSearch` uses) arrive presentation-ready. Each row is one page **or** one of its heading sections, and carries a breadcrumb plus pre-highlighted text, so a component can render matches without doing any string work of its own:

```json
{
  "url": "/docs/framework/site/#assets",
  "title": "Site architecture",
  "heading": "Assets",
  "crumbs": ["Framework", "Site architecture"],
  "titleTokens": [{ "t": "Assets", "m": true }],
  "excerptTokens": [
    { "t": "…referenced from a page are copied into ", "m": false },
    { "t": "assets", "m": true },
    { "t": "/ at build time…", "m": false }
  ],
  "score": 9.1
}
```

A token's `m` flag marks a run that matched a query term, whole words, so a prefix search for `intro` highlights `introduction`. Map over the tokens and style the matched runs; nothing is injected as HTML:

```json
{
  "$prototype": "Array",
  "items": { "$ref": "$map/item/titleTokens" },
  "map": {
    "tagName": "span",
    "attributes": { "class": "${item.m ? 'hl' : ''}" },
    "textContent": "${item.t}"
  }
}
```

`crumbs` is the slug's ancestor trail, with the page title appended on a section row. `excerptTokens` cover a ~160-character window around the first body match, elided with `…` when it doesn't reach an edge. At most `pageCap` rows (default 3) come from any one page, so a long page can't flood the list.

:::doc-tip
Grouped results (`group: true`, the default and what the `Search` prototype returns) keep the older nested shape: a page with a `hits` array of its matching sections. Use flat rows for a search palette, grouped for a results page organized by document.
:::

:::doc-note
One index per site is the assumption: the first `preload` wins the in-page singleton. Multiple collections are fine; they share the one index and results carry their `collection` name.
