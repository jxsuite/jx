# Embedding overview

Jx Studio is one web app that runs against whatever backend hosts it. The `@jxsuite/studio` package contains all UI logic and imports no platform-specific modules. The same codebase ships as the desktop app, as the dev-mode editor in Chrome, and as a cloud editor in a plain browser. Everything environment-specific is injected at startup: file I/O, project loading, git, component discovery. If you're building a backend or host for Studio, this page maps the layers and helps you pick where to plug in.

## The two layers

Studio's backend abstraction has two layers, and you implement exactly one of them:

- **The platform adapter (PAL)** is an in-page JavaScript object implementing the `StudioPlatform` interface, registered via `registerPlatform()` before Studio boots. Every Studio operation calls the current adapter; nothing in Studio fetches a backend URL directly.
- **The backend protocol** is the wire contract behind the adapters, defined once in `@jxsuite/protocol`: a canonical route table plus the request/response types. The sub-path, method, and body shapes are the contract; the transport and path prefix are free.

Every adapter ultimately speaks the protocol. The stock adapters differ only in transport: one speaks literal HTTP, one speaks native RPC, one speaks HTTP behind a session gateway.

## Who implements what today

| Host                                     | Platform adapter                                                     | Transport                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dev server (`@jxsuite/server`)           | `packages/studio/src/platforms/devserver.ts` (registered by default) | The literal `/__studio/*` HTTP routes, the protocol's reference implementation                            |
| Desktop (ElectroBun / Chromium app-mode) | `packages/desktop/src/platform.ts`                                   | Typed RPC / WebSocket JSON-RPC into the same handlers, behind a loopback-only, token-gated project server |
| Cloud platforms                          | `packages/studio/src/platforms/cloud.ts`                             | HTTP behind a session gateway (`/api/v1/p/:owner/:repo/:branch/studio/*`), same sub-paths and shapes      |

## Choosing your integration path

**Serve the HTTP protocol** when your backend can expose HTTP endpoints. Implement the protocol's core routes at `/__studio/*` (or an equivalent prefix) and reuse the stock dev-server adapter unchanged, because Studio registers it automatically when no other platform is present and your page declares no boot module of its own. Your backend can be written in any language; a conformance check is just iterating the route table and asserting every core route answers. This is the least code and the path most hosted backends take. Start at [the backend protocol](/docs/extending/embedding/backend-protocol).

**Implement `StudioPlatform` in-page** when the transport isn't plain HTTP (a native RPC bridge like the desktop app's, a session gateway with its own path scheme and auth like the cloud adapter's), or when you need to own the client-side pieces the protocol can't cover. Project opening is the clearest example: it's inherently a client concern (a native file dialog on desktop, `showDirectoryPicker()` in Chrome, a project list on cloud), so it lives in the adapter, not on the wire. Start at [writing a platform adapter](/docs/extending/embedding/platform-adapter).

Either way, the semantics come from `@jxsuite/protocol`. An in-page adapter should behave exactly as the corresponding routes describe, because Studio can't tell the difference.

## Partial backends are fine

You don't have to implement everything. Optional protocol routes back optional `StudioPlatform` members; Studio checks for their presence and degrades exactly as each route's `degradation` entry describes: the starter picker empties, the Projects catalogue hides, realtime co-editing falls back to solo file-level saves, and so on. The [protocol route reference](/docs/extending/reference/studio-routes) lists every route with its optionality and degradation.
