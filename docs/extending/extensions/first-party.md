# First-party extensions

Five extensions ship with Jx, and they are deliberately unprivileged: each is wired through the same manifest, admission blocks, and capability roles available to any third-party package. They are both the batteries most projects start with and the reference implementations to crib from when you build your own. This page maps what each one contributes; follow the links for the mechanics.

| Package              | Sections              | Formats       | Server mounts          | Connector providers  |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| `@jxsuite/parser`    | `content`             | Markdown, CSV | —                      | —                    |
| `@jxsuite/connector` | `connections`, `data` | —             | `/_jx/data` (order 20) | D1, Supabase, Sqlite |
| `@jxsuite/auth`      | `auth`                | —             | `/_jx/auth` (order 10) | —                    |
| `@jxsuite/search`    | `search`              | —             | —                      | —                    |
| `@jxsuite/feed`      | `feed`                | —             | —                      | —                    |

## @jxsuite/parser: content and Markdown

The content layer, and the model [format extension](/docs/extending/extensions/formats).

- **Section**: `content`, file-based content collections owned by the `Content` class (`referenceable`, so collections join the relationships vocabulary). Its `projectData` and `resolvePaths` capabilities load collections into `_project.content` and expand `$paths` for pages discovery.
- **Formats**: `Markdown` (`.md`, admitted to pages, components, and content; an `exportTarget` with parse, serialize, discover, and load capabilities) and `Csv` (`.csv`, content-only, `remote: true` so sources may be `http(s)` URLs).
- **Classes**: `MarkdownCollection`, `ContentCollection`, `ContentEntry`, which are glob-and-query state prototypes over content files.
- **Schemas**: the only first-party package shipping a `document` fragment as well as a `project` one, so its content-source shapes join both [composed schemas](/docs/extending/extensions/schema-composition).
- **Studio settings**: the **Content Types** section, a `layout: "map"` master-detail with the `schema-builder` control for frontmatter fields.

User-level docs: [Content collections](/docs/framework/site/content-collections) and [Jx Markdown](/docs/framework/site/jx-markdown).

## @jxsuite/connector: connections and data tables

The data layer, and the reference for both the [connector block](/docs/extending/extensions/connectors) and a [server mount](/docs/extending/extensions/server).

- **Sections**: `connections` (named database connections; identifiers and env-var names only) and `data` (dynamic tables: column schema, id strategy, indexes, permissions, `ownerField`; `referenceable`).
- **Providers**: `D1`, `Supabase`, and `Sqlite` classes, each with the four connector capabilities (`dialect`, `deploySchema`, `bindings`, `testConnection`) over a shared Kysely bridge.
- **Mount**: `/_jx/data` (order 20), the canonical table wire contract, fail-closed against `ctx.auth`.
- **Classes**: `TableQuery`, `TableEntry`, `TableInsert`, `TableUpdate`, `TableDelete`, state prototypes that [lower](/docs/extending/extensions/capabilities) to core `Request`/`Function` defs in compiled sites.
- **Studio settings**: **Connections** and **Data Tables** sections (`layout: "map"`), with the `secret` control for connection URLs and the `schema-builder` for table fields. **Test Connection** and **Push Schema** are built on the connector capabilities.

User-level docs: [Databases](/docs/studio/data), [Connections](/docs/studio/data/connections), [Data tables](/docs/studio/data/tables), [Data grid](/docs/studio/data/grid).

## @jxsuite/auth: sessions and permissions

Better Auth behind the connector's tables, and the reference for mount cooperation through the shared context.

- **Section**: `auth`, holding sign-in methods, redirects, roles, and the connection its system tables (`user`, `session`, `account`, `verification`) live on.
- **Mount**: `/_jx/auth` (order 10), serving Better Auth's routes and publishing `ctx.auth = { getSession, authorize }` for the data mount to authorize against. Without it, table rules beyond `public`/`none` deny.
- **Push contribution**: a section-owner `deploySchema` capability contributes the system-table migration to `jx db push` as `kind: "auth"` steps ([Server mounts](/docs/extending/extensions/server)).
- **Classes**: `Session` (the live session, `null` when signed out, and always `null` outside browsers, so static pages render signed-out) and `AuthActions` (`signInEmail`, `signUpEmail`, `signInSocial`, `signOut` handlers to wire onto forms). Both default to client timing via `$studio.stateDefaults`.
- **Studio settings**: the **Authentication** section (`layout: "form"`), with the `secret` control for `secretEnv`. The signing secret itself never touches `project.json` ([Security and secrets](/docs/extending/extensions/security)).

User-level docs: [Auth and secrets](/docs/studio/data/auth-and-secrets).

## @jxsuite/search: build-time site search

Headless full-text search, and the reference for the [`emit` capability](/docs/extending/extensions/search).

- **Section**: `search`, naming which content collections to index, per-collection fields and boosts, and the output path. `projectData` normalizes it into `_project.search`.
- **Emit**: builds `/search-index.json` at build time from the loaded content collections, as page-level documents plus per-heading section documents with `#anchor` deep links (heading ids come from the parser).
- **Classes**: `Search`, reactive query results in page state, [lowered](/docs/extending/extensions/capabilities) to a core `Function` computed that lazy-loads the bundled MiniSearch client. Defaults to client timing via `$studio.stateDefaults`.
- **Client**: `@jxsuite/search/client`, a headless browser module (`preload`/`query` plus `$src` state conventions) bundled into `/assets/` by the site build; sites author their own search UI over it.
- **Studio settings**: the **Site Search** section (`layout: "form"`).

User-level docs: [Site search](/docs/framework/site/search).

## @jxsuite/feed: syndication feeds

Atom and JSON Feed documents written at build time, and the reference for the [`head` capability](/docs/extending/extensions/capabilities).

- **Section**: `feed`, one entry per feed. Each names the `collection` it syndicates and the `basePath` its entries are served under, and may set a title, a description, the `formats` to emit, the `output` base path, a `pageSize`, and whether to write RFC 5005 `archive` pages.
- **Emit**: writes `/feed.xml` (Atom, RFC 4287) and `/feed.json` (JSON Feed) from the loaded content collection. RSS 2.0 is deliberately not offered: it has no standards body, and every reader handles Atom.
- **Head**: contributes the `<link rel="alternate">` tags that let a browser and a reader discover the feeds, so a page does not have to declare them by hand.
- **Classes**: `Feed`, which owns the section and both capabilities. It registers no format and no state prototype, which makes it the smallest of the five and the easiest to read first.
- **Studio settings**: the **Feeds** section (`layout: "map"`), one entry at a time.

## How they depend on each other

Auth depends on the connector (its dialect seam and permission types); search and feed both read what the parser loads but depend only on core; all of them may depend on core packages; core packages never depend on any of them. That direction is CI-enforced, and it is what guarantees the claim these pages keep making: anything the first-party extensions do, yours can do too.
