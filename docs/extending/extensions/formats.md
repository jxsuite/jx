# Custom formats

A format teaches Jx a new file type. Jx _is_ JSON, so `.json` is the single native built-in; every other extension a project opens, saves, builds, or loads content from (`.md`, `.csv`, your `.toml`) is dispatched through a format class. A class participates in format dispatch iff its `.class.json` descriptor carries a top-level `format` object.

## The `format` block

The parser's `Markdown.class.json` declares, verbatim:

```json
"format": {
  "extensions": [".md"],
  "mediaType": "text/markdown; variant=GFM",
  "documentKinds": ["page", "component", "content"],
  "exportTarget": true,
  "remote": false
}
```

| Key             | Type                                 | Default | Meaning                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `extensions`    | `string[]` (required)                | —       | File extensions claimed, with leading dot.                                                                                                   |
| `mediaType`     | `string`                             | —       | Media type; **validated**, so a malformed value fails the registry build. Used for icons, labels and HTTP responses.                         |
| `documentKinds` | `("page"\|"component"\|"content")[]` | `[]`    | `page`/`component` admit the extension into pages/components discovery globs; `content` admits it as a content source.                       |
| `exportTarget`  | `boolean`                            | `false` | When true, site builds emit a serialized sidecar per page in this format (requires a `serialize` capability).                                |
| `remote`        | `boolean`                            | `false` | When true, the `load` capability accepts `http(s)` URLs as sources. Remote content sources **must** name a remote-capable format explicitly. |

Two classes may claim the same extension **only with disjoint capabilities**. The registry build fails on an ambiguous `(extension, capability)` pair. A registry never claims `.json`.

### mediaType is checked

Your `mediaType` reaches an HTTP header, a file-picker filter and a Studio label, so it's parsed rather than passed through. Get the grammar wrong and the build tells you:

```text
Format "Toml" declares an invalid mediaType: "applicationtoml" has no "/" — a media type is type/subtype (RFC 6838 §4.2)
```

The check is on the **syntax**, not the IANA registry: `application/x.my-format` is fine, and so is any subtype nobody has registered.

Parameters are welcome and carry meaning. `@jxsuite/parser` declares `text/markdown; variant=GFM`, which is how [RFC 7763](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7763) says _which_ markdown a format speaks:

```json
"format": {
  "extensions": [".md"],
  "mediaType": "text/markdown; variant=GFM"
}
```

:::doc-note
A file-picker `accept` map or an editor language id **keys** on a media type. In code like that, use the _essence_ (`text/markdown`), not the declared string. `mediaTypeEssence` on the registry entry gives you that. Two Studio call sites broke the moment the `variant` parameter was declared, which is why the distinction exists.
:::

### What a static file server sends

Your `format` block only reaches code that went through the registry. A `.md` file served straight off disk (by the dev server, or by `jx preview`) never touches it, and the platform's own table answers instead.

For most extensions that's fine. For two it isn't, so Jx overrides them:

| Extension       | Platform says           | Jx sends                     | Why                                                                  |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.md`           | `text/markdown`         | `text/markdown; variant=GFM` | Bare `text/markdown` doesn't say _which_ markdown ([RFC 7763][7763]) |
| `.yaml`, `.yml` | `text/yaml`, or nothing | `application/yaml`           | `text/yaml` is the pre-registration spelling ([RFC 9512][9512] §5)   |

[7763]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7763
[9512]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9512

Everything else keeps whatever the host already decided. This list corrects a lookup, it isn't a second MIME table. A test asserts that the `.md` entry and the parser's declared `mediaType` agree, because they live in files that can't import each other.

## Format capabilities

The block declares _what_ the class handles; the class's [capability methods](/docs/extending/extensions/capabilities) declare _how_. Five roles belong to the `format` block:

| Role        | Signature                                                     | Consumers                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `parse`     | `(source, options?) → JxDocument`                             | compiler, server, Studio (open file)        |
| `serialize` | `(doc, options?) → string`                                    | Studio (save), site build (export sidecars) |
| `rewrite`   | `(source, edits) → string`                                    | the rename refactor (repair a reference)    |
| `discover`  | `(source, { baseDir }) → string[]`                            | content loading (list entry files)          |
| `load`      | `(path, { schema, directiveOptions }) → ContentLoaderEntry[]` | content loading (parse one source)          |

A format implements the subset it needs: a read-only format can ship `parse` without `serialize` (Studio then opens files in this format read-only in structural modes); a data-only format like `Csv` needs `discover`/`load` but has no reason to be a page format.

### `rewrite`: repairing a reference without round-tripping

`serialize` promises a lot: that a parsed document turns back into source your author would recognize. A data format often cannot promise it. Re-emitting a CSV means picking a quoting style, a line ending and a column order the author already picked, and the loader has no opinion about any of them.

But a rename does not need a document back. It needs one cell's text changed. That is what `rewrite` is:

```ts
static rewrite(source: string, edits: readonly { from: string; to: string }[]): string
```

You are handed the file's own text and a list of authored values to replace, and you return the text with exactly those values replaced and every other byte preserved. Two rules make it safe:

- **Match whole values, never substrings.** `hero.jpg` must not rewrite the middle of `my-hero.jpg`.
- **Change nothing else.** Padding, quoting and line endings are the author's.

Declare it and the rename refactor repairs references living in your format instead of reporting them as something the author has to fix by hand. Declare both and the refactor prefers `serialize`, because a full round trip can express a change a list of value edits cannot, such as renaming a custom-element tag.

:::doc-note
`rewrite` is not a weaker `serialize`, and the two are not ranked. Declare either, both, or neither. Only `serialize` makes your format creatable and convertible in Studio; `rewrite` earns nothing but the refactor, which is exactly what a load-only format wants.
:::

The `Markdown` class implements all four, plus the standard instance `resolve()`, so `{ "$prototype": "Markdown", "src": "./about.md" }` works as runtime state, satisfying the same [external class contract](/docs/extending/extensions/classes) as every other class.

## How the pipeline dispatches

Hosts never hard-code file types. Each one builds a format registry from the enabled extensions' manifests and routes by extension:

- **Pages and components discovery**: the site build and dev server glob for `.json` plus every extension whose format declares the matching `documentKind`, then call `parse` on non-JSON matches. This is why adding a Markdown page is just dropping `pages/about.md` in a parser-enabled project.
- **Content loading**: a `content` section entry names a format (or derives it from the source's file extension); the loader calls `discover` to list entry files, then `load` per file, validating each entry against the content type's schema. See [Content collections](/docs/framework/site/content-collections).
- **Studio editing**: opening a claimed file calls `parse` to get the Jx tree the canvas edits; saving calls `serialize`. When a capability's `timing` excludes the browser, Studio round-trips through the dev server's `POST /__studio/format` endpoint instead of importing the implementation ([Studio routes](/docs/extending/reference/studio-routes)).
- **Export sidecars**: with `exportTarget: true`, the build serializes each page into the format next to its HTML output.

## Studio hints

Format classes describe their Studio control surface declaratively in a top-level `$studio` block. Studio interprets this data generically and never hard-codes per-format element sets. From `Markdown.class.json`, abbreviated:

```json
"$studio": {
  "icon": "markdown",
  "modes": ["edit", "design", "preview", "source"],
  "documentMode": {
    "default": "content",
    "componentWhen": { "frontmatterKey": "tagName", "matches": ".+-.+" }
  },
  "newFileTemplate": "---\ntitle: Untitled\n---\n\n",
  "elements": {
    "block": ["h1", "h2", "h3", "p", "blockquote", "ul", "ol", "li", "pre", "…"],
    "inline": ["em", "strong", "del", "code", "a", "img", "br"],
    "void": ["hr", "br", "img"],
    "textOnly": ["code"],
    "nesting": {
      "h1": { "block": false, "inline": true, "directive": false },
      "ul": { "only": ["li"] },
      "…": {}
    }
  }
}
```

- `icon`: file icon in the Files panel.
- `modes`: which canvas modes the format supports.
- `documentMode`: whether files open as prose content or as components, with an optional frontmatter-based override (here: a hyphenated `tagName` means "this .md file defines a custom element").
- `newFileTemplate`: the seed content for **New File** in this format.
- `elements`: the allowlist and nesting constraints gating structural editing, covering which tags the element picker offers, what may nest where, and which are void or text-only.

### What declaring both capabilities buys you

Studio derives two of its surfaces from `parse` and `serialize` rather than from any list of format names, so a format extension reaches both by declaring them:

- **The New File format picker** offers your extension when some installed class declares BOTH `parse` and `serialize` for it. Both are needed: without `parse` the file cannot be opened after it is created, and without `serialize` its first save falls through to another format and writes that format's bytes into it. (This is why the parser extension's `Csv`, which parses rows and has no serializer, is not offered; a `.csv` is still creatable through the picker's **Other…** row. `Csv` declares `rewrite` instead, which buys it the refactor and not this picker.)
- **Convert Format…** offers your format as a conversion endpoint when it declares both capabilities **and** `page` or `component` in `documentKinds`. That membership is what says `parse` returns a Jx document rather than content entries, and the compiler already relies on it to build its page and component globs, so there is no separate declaration to make.

`.json` is the endpoint both surfaces share, because no registry ever claims it.

One more generic hint applies to any class, not just formats: `$studio.stateDefaults`, an object merged into state entries Studio creates for the prototype. The connector's `TableQuery` sets `{ "timing": "client" }` so Studio-created queries default to browser resolution.
