# Contributing to these docs

The documentation lives in `/docs` at the monorepo root, published through the jxsuite.com site. Every page is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter; the folder path is the URL (`docs/studio/editing.md` → `/docs/studio/editing/`).

## Adding a page

1. Create the Markdown file under the right section (`start/`, `studio/`, `framework/`, `extending/`).
2. Add frontmatter: `title` (sentence case, no site suffix) and `description` (≤155 characters).
3. Add one line to `docs/nav.json`: to the section's own `pages` if the page sits directly under it, otherwise to the `pages` of the group it belongs to. The sidebar is generated from it, and CI fails if a page is missing from nav, or if nav points at a missing page. A new group needs a `label` and at least one page, and neither a `pages` nor a `groups` array may ever be empty.
4. Run `bun run docs:check` before pushing.

Optional frontmatter associates a page with its sources, validated by CI:

```yaml
spec:
  - spec.md#19.4 # a specs/ file and numbered section
code:
  - packages/runtime/src/runtime.ts # repo paths that must exist
```

In the other direction, code comments may carry `@docs <slug>` tags (e.g. `@docs framework/concepts/reactivity`) pointing at the page that documents them. Those are validated too.

These associations also power `bun run docs:sync`: given your working diff, it lists the pages and spec sections tied to the source files you changed. It runs automatically as a pre-commit advisory (and as an agent stop-check), so behavior changes and their documentation land together. It never blocks, because a pure refactor needs no doc update.

Your page is also published for machines. After `jx build`, the site build runs `scripts/docs/build-llm-export.ts`, which regenerates `llms.txt` and `/docs/full-docs.json` from the same frontmatter and Markdown: the whole corpus, in nav order, served verbatim to whatever fetches it. In `llms.txt` each page is one line, `- [Title](url): description`, so your `description` is nearly everything an agent has before deciding whether to open the page. Make it say what the page covers rather than restate the title. See [Machine-readable docs](/docs/framework/agents/machine-readable).

## Voice and style

- Second person, present tense, imperative steps: "Click **New Project**", not "The New Project button can be clicked".
- Sentence-case headings; one H1 matching the frontmatter title.
- Studio and Start pages assume no code knowledge. Code belongs in Framework/Extending pages, or inside a `:::doc-note` aside.
- Bold for clickable UI labels (**Commit & Sync**); `:kbd[Ctrl+K]` for keys (give macOS and Windows/Linux pairs on first mention); backticks only for literal code, filenames, and JSON keys.
- Chevron click paths for navigation chains: _Settings > CSS Variables_.
- American English, short paragraphs, no marketing superlatives.

### Write it the way you would say it

The point of every rule below is that a reader should be able to hear a person behind the page. Read a paragraph aloud before you keep it. If you would not say it, rewrite it.

**Dashes.** Do not use em dashes (`—`) or en dashes (–) in prose. They are the strongest single tell that a page was drafted by a model, and this corpus had one every forty-four words. An en dash between numbers or key names is a range (`0–100`, `` `h1`–`h6` ``) and is fine; a bare `—` in a table cell means "none" and is fine. Everywhere else, the dash is doing one of three jobs, and each has a better answer:

- _An aside holding a list._ Put the list at the end behind a colon, or split the sentence. A comma cannot do this job, because the aside is already full of commas. `Every backend-touching operation in Studio — file I/O, project loading, git — goes through the adapter` becomes `Every backend-touching operation in Studio goes through the adapter: file I/O, project loading, git.`
- _A clause tacked onto the end._ Promote it to its own sentence when it is a second fact, join it with "because" or "so" when it is a reason, and cut it when it only restates the sentence it is attached to. Vary between the three; six colons in a row is a new tic.
- _A single appositive._ A comma, a colon, or parentheses.

**Bold labels in lists.** Bold a list item's opening words when they are a label the reader will see on screen or type into a file: a button, a panel, a field, a JSON key, a package name. Do not bold a category you invented to introduce a sentence. The test is whether the reader could search the app or the file for that exact string. A list of four packages compared across the same five fields is a table in list form and should stay one; four sentences wearing headings should be a paragraph.

**Related-links tails.** A `## Related` or `## Next` item is `- [Link](slug): what it covers.` when the gloss is a bare noun phrase, or `- **[Link](slug)** verbs the rest of the sentence.` when it reads better as one. Either is within the dash rule; pick one and keep it consistent down the page.

**Sentence length.** Aim under thirty words. A long sentence is fine when it is carrying a real chain of reasoning, and a short one is fine for emphasis, but a page where every sentence lands on the same medium-length beat reads like a machine. Vary it.

**A quoted UI message is quoted verbatim**, dash and all. When a page shows what Studio says, the point is that a reader can match it against their screen, so the dash rule does not reach inside the quotation marks. Add an allow entry to `scripts/docs/prose.json` instead. Paraphrasing is fine where the message is templated and no fixed string exists. A rendered label inside a code span needs no allow entry, because the segmenter masks code spans before any rule runs: `` `h1 — Latest posts` `` on [The workspace](/docs/studio/interface) is what `nodeLabel()` really prints, and it stays.

**Say it once.** Do not follow a heading with a sentence that only repeats it. A definition sentence is different and is required on a surface page, but it has to add the where and the what for: "Grid is for tabular data" earns its place; "Grid mode is a mode for grids" does not. No more than two sections in a row may open with the same frame.

**Do not tell the reader what to think.** Cut "worth noting", "it's important to understand", "the key thing here". If it matters, the substance shows it. Cut throat-clearing openers too: "Let's look at", "Here's where it gets interesting", "At its core".

**Do not answer objections nobody raised**, and do not introduce an option only to reject it. "A tempting approach would be X, but" usually records an old draft rather than telling the reader anything.

**Never invent a fact to make a sentence flow.** If a rewrite needs a number, a threshold, or a name the source does not give, leave the sentence longer or ask. This applies hardest to the words that carry the contract: `never`, `always`, `only`, `must`, `all`, `none`. Those are not intensifiers to be softened.

**What to keep.** Concrete behavioral detail, negative claims, the bug that motivated a rule, an aside in parentheses, a short sentence used deliberately. Those are what make a page sound like someone who has used the thing.

## Canonical UI names

Never invent synonyms for Studio surfaces. The shell regions are the **Command Bar** and the **Command Center** pill in the middle of it, the **Navigator rail** and its **Navigator** dock, the **pane** (with its **context bar** and, above that, its **jump bar**), the **Inspector**, the **Bottom dock** and the **status bar**.

The Navigator panels are **Files, Source Control** and **Problems** (the rail's Project group) and **Outline, Page, Data** and **Packages** (its Document group). **Insert** has no rail button and is opened by name from the palette. **Languages** belongs to the Project group but stays off the rail, and appears only in a project with more than one locale. A **Search** panel is declared and not yet built, so it never shows. The Inspector tabs are **Content, Style, Logic, Assistant**; the Bottom dock's are **Problems, Logic, Activity**. Diff is not one of them: it is an **Editor** kind, and Source Control opens a changed file as a Diff editor in the side pane. A pane's **View** control offers **Edit, Design, Preview**, and its **Editor** control names the editor kind: **Canvas, Grid, Code, Diff, Library, Project Styles**. Inside the Diff editor the two halves are **Visual** and **Code**: never "Rendered", never "Raw", and never "Source", which names a different thing.

A **View** is a view and an **Editor** is an editor: write "the Code editor", never "Code mode", because _mode_ belongs to the View control and mixing the two axes is what the modes page spends its opening paragraph separating.

**The palette** is an acceptable collective for the **Command Center** (:kbd[⌘K]) and **Quick Access** (:kbd[⌘P]) where the difference does not matter. Name one of them where it does.

**Settings** is the project's (contexts, content types, connections, packages); **Preferences** is the application's (appearance, assistant, accounts, keyboard). Never use one word for the other.

## Source formatting

**Write each paragraph on one line.** Do not wrap prose in the source file. Your editor's soft wrap re-flows to whatever width you are reading at; a file wrapped at 100 columns is already flowed to somebody else's width, and the two interleave into ragged half-width lines that change shape with the window. It also makes review harder: editing a wrapped paragraph re-flows every line after the edit, so a one-word change arrives as a five-line diff and a reviewer checking that a rewrite kept every claim has to reconstruct the sentences first.

`bun run format:md` rewrites a wrapped file, so you can write however you like and let the formatter settle it. Much of the corpus is still wrapped from before the rule; the sweep that fixes that is a separate change, and until it lands the CI gate checks escapes only.

The one thing to know is what happens to a line break that means something. Ordinary paragraph breaks are wrapping and get joined. A line break you want the reader to see is a **hard break**, written as a trailing backslash:

```markdown
**Version:** 0.4.2\
**Status:** Partial
```

The formatter keeps those, and writes them for you in the two cases it can recognise: a run of lines that each open with a bold key, as a spec header does, and a line whose whole content is one text directive. Everything else with structure in its line breaks is a different block to begin with, so it is never at risk: tables, fenced and indented code, frontmatter, headings, list items, block quotes, container directives, HTML blocks, and link and footnote definitions all keep their own lines.

Two trailing spaces are also a hard break in Markdown, and the formatter rewrites them to a backslash. An invisible break is one that an editor set to trim trailing whitespace, or a careless paste, deletes without anyone noticing.

**A pipe inside a table cell has to be escaped.** Write `\|`, or the renderer reads it as the start of the next cell: the row grows a column, the surplus cells are dropped, and the text after the pipe takes the place of the one that vanished. Nothing about the page looks wrong until you read the column that lost its contents. `bun run docs:markdown` refuses any row whose cell count differs from its header, so a hand edit and a generator that forgets to escape are both caught. The formatter cannot fix one for you, because a row with too many cells does not say which of them was meant.

## Callouts

Three container directives render as styled asides:

```markdown
:::doc-note
Neutral context, including "behind the scenes" notes naming what Studio writes to disk.
:::

:::doc-tip
Shortcuts and good practices.
:::

:::doc-warning
Data loss or surprising behavior only.
:::
```

Use at most a couple per screenful, and never open a page with one.

## Page shapes

- **Studio surface page**: definition sentence (what it is, where it lives) → hero screenshot → "Open …" click path first → verb-first task sections with numbered steps and a screenshot after each state-changing step → a `:::doc-note` naming what Studio writes, linking the Framework counterpart → related links.
- **Framework concept page**: a "Studio writes this format for you" note linking the Studio surface → smallest complete JSON example first → one H2 per variant with a short example each → how it compiles → hard rules → related links.
- **Tutorial**: outcome + finished screenshot + rough duration + prerequisites → numbered steps with expected-result sentences ("You should now see…") → "What you built" recap → next steps.
- **Generated reference**: do not edit these. They carry a `GENERATED` banner and are produced by `bun run docs:generate` from package data, the specs' status markers, the specs' changelogs, and the specs' `## N. Standards Alignment` tables; CI fails on drift. Releasing a spec (`bun run spec:bump`) changes [Implementation status](/docs/extending/reference/implementation-status) and [Spec changelog](/docs/extending/reference/spec-changelog); editing a spec's Standards Alignment table changes [Standards alignment](/docs/extending/reference/standards). Regenerate in the same change set.

## Internal links

Write them as root-absolute slugs (`/docs/framework/site/routing`), with no `.md` extension and no trailing slash. Never use a relative `../foo.md` link: the site serves the target verbatim rather than rewriting it to a URL, so the link is broken the moment it publishes.

:::doc-note
`bun run docs:links` resolves every one of them: the slug against `docs/nav.json`, and any `#anchor` against the headings the target page actually publishes. A heading's anchor comes from its rendered text, lowercased, so **re-casing a heading is safe and rewording one is not**. `bun scripts/docs/check-doc-links.ts --anchors` lists every heading another page links to, which is what to check before you touch one.

## Screenshots

All screenshots come from the automated pipeline. None are hand-taken, so every image can be regenerated when the UI changes:

1. Declare the shot in `scripts/screenshots/manifest.json`. The shot contract is `open` (the world the app wakes up in), `steps`, `expect`, `capture` and `then`, and the full grammar is [`scripts/screenshots/README.md`](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/blob/main/scripts/screenshots/README.md). Give it a `docs` field listing the page slugs it illustrates.
2. Run `bun run screenshots`. Output lands in `docs/images/` and is committed alongside `scripts/screenshots/capture.lock.json`, which records the bytes and the shot definition each image came from.
3. Reference it **relative to your page**, e.g. `![descriptive alt text](../images/<name>.png)` from `docs/start/`, `../../images/<name>.png` one level deeper.

A step names a **command id** and a capture names a **region id**, never a CSS selector and never a sleep. `probe.idle()` decides when the app has settled, and a step must state the state it wants rather than flip it: `view.setAssistant` with `{ "open": false }`, never a toggle. A toggle depends on what the panel happened to be doing when the run reached it, so changing a default silently inverts every shot that used one; a setter cannot.

Relative paths are what make `/docs` readable in any markdown editor, because the images travel with the pages. The site build republishes them under `/content/docs/images/` (the `docs` collection's [asset mount](/docs/framework/site/content-collections)), which is also how a site page outside `/docs` references one.

Alt text is mandatory and describes the state shown ("Style inspector with the Typography section expanded"), not the filename. Shots drive the starter sites (real-estate by default, dark theme) so docs show real projects, not Jx internals. CI verifies every referenced image resolves into `docs/images/`, is produced by the manifest, exists on disk, and is one the capture lock names. A PNG the pipeline did not produce fails the build.
