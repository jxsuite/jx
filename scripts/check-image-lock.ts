/**
 * Check-image-lock.ts — the capture lock, and `docs:images:check` (UX-REDESIGN-PLAN §13.5).
 *
 * `scripts/docs/check-doc-refs.ts` asserts that a referenced image resolves into `docs/images/`,
 * that its basename is a name the manifest COULD produce, and `existsSync`. Nothing compares bytes,
 * and no CI job anywhere runs `bun run screenshots` — which is how two shots stayed red on main for
 * weeks under green CI, and why "screenshots come only from scripts/screenshots (never hand-taken)"
 * has been prose in CLAUDE.md and an honour system.
 *
 * This file mechanises it. `scripts/screenshots/capture.lock.json` is committed beside the
 * still-committed PNGs and records, per image, the bytes that were produced and the shot definition
 * they were produced from. Three assertions follow, all blocking:
 *
 * 1. **Exists + manifest-producible** — today's behaviour, now checked against the LOCK, so it holds
 *    on any checkout rather than on whatever happens to be in one working tree.
 * 2. **Never hand-taken** — a PNG in `docs/images/` whose `sha256` has no lock entry FAILS. An editor,
 *    a resize, a `curl` into the directory: all three are now a red X with a name on them.
 * 3. **Current** — each shot's definition hash is recomputed from the working tree and compared with
 *    what the capture recorded. A shot whose declared inputs changed without a re-capture fails.
 *    This is the wholly new guarantee, and the one the honour system could never give.
 *
 * Division of labour with `docs:check`, deliberately:
 *
 * - **`docs:check`** owns the assertions that need PAGE context to be actionable — "docs/x.md
 *   references an image no lock names", "docs/x.md references a quarantined shot". It imports
 *   {@link readLock}, {@link lockedImagePaths} and {@link quarantineRefFindings} from here; it does
 *   not hash a byte.
 * - **`docs:images:check`** (this file's CLI) owns the assertions that need BYTES — it is the only
 *   check that reads 25 MB of PNGs — plus definition currency, lock integrity and the quarantine
 *   report. Its failure has a different owner and a different fix ("re-run the lane", not "fix your
 *   frontmatter"), so it is a separate script rather than more code inside `check-doc-refs.ts`,
 *   which is 328 lines of top-level statements that cannot be imported without running.
 *
 * Both are chained into `docs:verify`, which is what CI runs.
 *
 * **The runner writes the lock; this file defines it.** `scripts/screenshots/run.ts` imports
 * {@link hashShotDefinition} / {@link shotDefinitionHashes}, {@link describeImage},
 * {@link readLock} and {@link writeLock} rather than reimplementing the format — a second
 * implementation of the hash is a lock that passes while meaning nothing.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *     bun scripts/check-image-lock.ts                      # the gate
 *     bun scripts/check-image-lock.ts --report out.md \    # the lane's PR comment
 *       --before-lock old.json --before-images /tmp/before/docs/images \
 *       --repo owner/name --before-sha <sha> --after-sha <sha>
