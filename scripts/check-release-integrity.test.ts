/**
 * Covers `scripts/check-release-integrity.ts` — the gate that would have caught, on the day it
 * happened, `packages/starters` being versioned to 1.3.0 in the manifest and never released.
 *
 * The release probe is injected, so the assertions below never touch GitHub: what is tested is the
 * tag arithmetic (which must track `release-please-config.json`, not a hardcoded shape), the gap
 * logic, and that the report names the cause.
