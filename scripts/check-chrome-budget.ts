// Enforces the chrome budget from packages/studio/UX-REDESIGN-PLAN.md §2, principle 9:
//
//   * At most five commands may declare `menus: ["commandbar/primary"]`.
//   * At most four tabs per dock.
//
// Chrome is earned by frequency, and a cap is the only version of that rule that survives contact
// With a deadline. Studio's toolbar is the counter-example: its own document strips every primary
// Label below 1140px rather than concede there are too many controls, so the fix for "one
// More button" has been "make them all anonymous". Under this check the fix is to retire a control
// To `commandbar/overflow`, where it keeps its name, its chord and its palette row.
//
// Run in the CI `checks` job: `bun scripts/check-chrome-budget.ts`
// Against a fixture:         `bun scripts/check-chrome-budget.ts --source <module.ts>`
//
// The source module exports `defaultCommandSet(): Command[]` and MAY export `dockTabs` to override
// The dock/tab sets.
//
// This is the one place the two halves are joined. `commands/budget.ts` stays free of DOM and state
// So three CI checks can load it in a bare Bun process, so it takes the rail groups as an argument;
// `panels/panel-registry.ts` is where the rail's names and groupings actually live, and
// `navigatorPanelSet()` is what populates it. The rail is therefore OBSERVED — a ninth panel fails
// This check in the commit that registers it, with nothing to remember to update.
