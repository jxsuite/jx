// Fails when a package source file never appears in coverage data, i.e. no
// Test imports it. Bun's coverage only counts files loaded during the run, so
// CoverageThreshold alone cannot catch a source file shipped with zero tests.
//
// Usage: bun scripts/check-coverage-manifest.ts packages/<pkg>
// Expects <pkg>/coverage/lcov.info from `bun test --coverage` (lcov reporter
// Is enabled in each package's bunfig.toml).
//
// ── Why a missing file gets a second question, not a verdict ──────────────────
//
// The gate's sentence ("no test imports them") is an INFERENCE from an absence,
// And on 20-21 Aug 2026 that inference was wrong. Bun 1.4.0 (+34cbb9a40) left
// `src/editor/convert-to-repeater.ts` out of the studio lcov on CI, in a run
// Whose log shows all fourteen of that file's tests passing against the real
// Implementation — opening its dialog, creating state defs, committing its
// Transaction. A mock cannot do those things, so the module was loaded, was
// Executed, and was still absent from both the lcov and the coverage table.
//
// That drop has since been reduced to a rule, and the rule has nothing to do
// With CI (jxsuite/jx#240). A source file M is omitted from BOTH the lcov and
// The table when TWO OR MORE dynamic `import("M")` calls are in flight AT ONCE
// — M's body still evaluates exactly once and its exports work; only the record
// Is lost. `Promise.all([import(M), import(M)])` loses it and two sequential
// `await import(M)` do not, which is the whole discriminator: overlap, not
// Un-awaitedness and not scale. `scripts/repro/bun-coverage-drop.sh` shows it
// Both directly and in the shape that reached this repo, in four files with no
// Jx code in them.
//
// A dropped file is ABSENT, not reported at 0%, so no per-file
// `coverageThreshold` can fire on it and the aggregate is computed as though it
// Were not there. That is the real severity, and it is what this script stands
// In front of.
//
// It read as CI-only for weeks because the studio instance needed one test file
// To overlap two imports and ANOTHER, running later, to load M for real — and
// `bun test` 1.4.0 ignores the order of its file arguments and re-scans the
// Test directory, so the "replay of CI's exact file order" this comment used to
// Cite as ruling order out never replayed an order at all. Readdir position was
// The only lever, and rewriting either file moves it, so the same clone flipped
// Between recording and not. It is also why a static import from the test did
// Not move it.
//
// The trigger is gone from this repo — `tests/commands-defaults.test.ts` doubles
// The converter, which its two siblings already did, so no two real imports of
// It ever overlap — and nothing here should be rescued today. The adjudication
// Stays anyway, because the next such defect will announce itself the same way:
// As an absence that means the opposite of what it says. What to look for is a
// Test that starts a second `import()` of a module before the first settles.
//
// So when a file is missing, ask the smaller question that has a definite
// Answer: re-run coverage over just the tests that name it. A file no test
// Exercises stays absent (nothing loads it) and still fails the gate — that is
// The regression this script exists to catch, and it is untouched. A file the
// Suite did run comes back with real counts, and those counts are then held to
// The same per-file `coverageThreshold` the workspace's bunfig applies, so a
// Rescued file is still gated on its coverage rather than waved through.
