/**
 * What the shot photographs, before the browser opens: the dev server, and the files under it.
 *
 * **The server.** The runner SPAWNS ITS OWN. It used to adopt whatever answered on the manifest
 * URL, which made every capture a photograph of whatever `packages/studio/dist` that server
 * happened to have been started with — a bundle nobody in the run could name. `bun scripts/dev.ts`
 * rebuilds the studio bundles at startup, so a server the runner started is by construction serving
 * the working tree. Reuse survives as `--reuse-server`, for tuning shot definitions against an
 * editor's live server: opt-in, announced, and gated on {@link assertBundleFresh}, because a reused
 * server is exactly the case where the bundle can be older than the source.
 *
 * **The files.** No shot opens a committed project. {@link overlayProject} materialises a
 * copy-on-write copy under `.cache/screenshots/` and the shot opens that, so a step that types into
 * a page cannot reach `packages/starters/**`. This deletes a real hazard rather than a theoretical
 * one: `slash-menu-shot` pressed Enter into a committed starter file and then ran a cleanup
 * "variant" to undo the damage — one crash away from corrupting a starter, and one of the two shots
 * red on main. With the overlay there is nothing to undo, and `variants`' cleanup role goes with
 * it.
 *
 * **The git fixture.** A project directory carrying `fixture.json` is materialised as a real git
 * repository with pinned author/committer dates and a stated dirty set
 * ({@link materialiseGitFixture}), so the `git-panel` shot stops photographing whatever the author
 * left uncommitted in this monorepo. A nested `.git` cannot itself be committed to a parent
 * repository, so the fixture ships as its plain working files plus a recipe, and the repository is
 * built at capture time.
