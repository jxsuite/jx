/**
 * One shot, executed against the contract (UX-REDESIGN-PLAN §13.2–§13.4).
 *
 * Boot the app into a stated world, drive it through named capabilities, assert, photograph region
 * ids. Nothing in this file names a CSS selector, and nothing in it sleeps.
 *
 * **Two nets, and they are not redundant.** `probe.idle()` is the APP's own account of whether it
 * has finished reacting — renders, panel schedulers, canvas generations, in-flight PAL calls — and
 * it rejects with `blockedBy`, which the runner prints as the shot's failure. Around it sits the
 * runner's own quiescence: outstanding network requests per frame, running Web Animations, fonts,
 * and a focus ring that has stopped moving. The app cannot see the network the canvas iframe is
 * doing (that is what made `hero` drift 15%) and the runner cannot see a queued lit render, so both
 * exist and both are cheap.
 *
 * **What was deleted here, and why it is not coming back.** `waitForCanvasReady`, `runWait`,
 * `hook(page, "setX")`, `canvasFrame()`'s "Studio's only child frame" (a coin flip the moment P8
 * adds a second host) and the `Math.abs(scale - 1) < 0.001` branch that guessed whether a fit
 * transform was in play. `probe.pointAt()` answers in TOP-DOCUMENT coordinates, per host, because
 * the app composes its own transforms and the runner never should have been re-deriving them.

 * it was taken while the lane still passed `--force`: `writeIfChanged` never ran, so it recorded

 * 7ce93986. The ten days after it are the first honest sample — 51 commits, 181 rewrites, every
 * delta recomputed from the committed blobs with `changedPixelRatio` at `CHANNEL_TOLERANCE`:
 *
 * | Δ              | rewrites | the shots that dominate it                |
 * | -------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
 * | ≤ 0.02 %       | 29       | the rail's git badge: mode-*, state-panel |
 * | (0.02, 0.05 %] | 29       | `media-upload`'s drop-zone indicator ×19  |
 * | (0.05, 0.10 %] | 25       | a `data-grid` cell's range outline ×13    |
 * | (0.10, 0.25 %] | 43       | `blog-grid`'s collection row order ×12    |

 *
 * The four bands were fixed WHERE THEY ARE CAUSED rather than absorbed here — between them
 * `mode-manage`, `media-upload`, `data-grid` and `blog-grid` were 74 of the 181 rewrites. Each was
 * diagnosed from the committed blobs, by taking the changed-pixel bounding box of every historical
 * rewrite: body copy re-rendering while every heading stayed byte-identical (a webfont race, see
 * {@link frameBlockers}), a cell outline present in one capture and absent in the next (the grid
 * called itself settled on the range MODEL, `grid/grid-view.ts`), and rows swapping places (an
 * unsorted directory listing, `byPathOrder` in `server/src/studio-api.ts`). None of that is
 * something a threshold could have separated from a real edit: their deltas are stable and small,
 * so a value that hid them would hide everything they are indistinguishable from.
 *
 * 0.01 is where the distribution stops looking like noise, and the two signatures are what separate
 * them. Noise REPEATS at a stable small value — `mode-manage` 22 times at a median 0.075 %,
 * `media-upload` 21 times at 0.038 %. A real edit happens ONCE and is large — `elements-panel` at
 * 68 %, `new-project-modal` at 46 %. All sixteen rewrites between 1 % and 5 % carry the second
 * signature, which is why this stops at 1 % instead of the 5 % that would suppress them too.
 *
 * This DOES give up the ~0.1 % status-bar regression 0.0002 was sized to catch, and that is the
 * trade, made deliberately: at 0.0002 the gate reported that regression alongside 152 other
 * rewrites in ten days, so nobody read it, and `docs/images` grew to 90 % of the repository's pack
 * — 567 of 634 MiB, 1,401 blob versions of 64 files. A gate nobody reads catches nothing either.

 * so the metric could not see text at all: the rail losing two buttons and the status bar being
 * rewritten together scored 0.07 %, the stale bytes were kept, and the lock then certified a
 * picture of an app that no longer existed as current. A screenshot pipeline that reports
 * "unchanged" for a changed app is worse than no pipeline, because it converts a stale picture into
 * an attested one.
 *
 * The metric is now a COUNT of pixels that moved more than this tolerance, at native resolution.
 * Anti-aliasing and font-hinting jitter move edge pixels a little and few of them; a control that
 * appeared, moved or changed its words moves many pixels a lot. `DIFF_THRESHOLD` is the fraction of
 * the frame that may do so and still count as noise.
 *
 * This tolerance is the half of the pair that did NOT move: 16 is wide enough that anti-aliasing
 * and font-hinting jitter never register, and narrow enough that a redrawn control always does.
 * `DIFF_THRESHOLD` went from 0.0002 to 0.01 instead — and the argument that used to close this
 * paragraph is the thing measurement overturned. It read: "churn is the cheaper failure — a
 * re-captured image that did not need re-capturing costs a diff, and a kept image that did costs a
 * documentation page that lies." At 0.0002 a diff is not what churn cost. It cost 1,401 blob
 * versions of 64 images, 90 % of this repository's pack, and a report of 181 rewrites in ten days
 * that no reviewer could triage — which is the same blindness by a different route. Both failures

     arrived, no request is in flight, no face reports `loading`, `document.fonts.status` is
     "loaded" over a set that has not started — and the frame is declared quiet while its body copy
     is still painted in the fallback face. The real face swaps in a frame later.

     Measured, that is the single largest source of screenshot churn in this repository:
     `mode-manage` (22 rewrites) and `media-upload` (21) are starter sites whose body font is
     remote, and the changed pixels are the body copy alone — every heading, in a face already
     resident, is byte-identical. The network condition cannot see it either, because at the moment
     it is asked there is genuinely nothing in flight.

     Triggering the declared-but-unstarted faces closes the window: `load()` moves a face to
     "loading" synchronously, so this same poll reports blocked, the runner keeps waiting, and the
