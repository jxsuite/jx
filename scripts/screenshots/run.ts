/**
 * The screenshot runner.
 *
 * Reads `scripts/screenshots/manifest.json`, spawns the repo dev server (so the bundle in the
 * picture is the working tree's), materialises a writable overlay of every project a shot opens,
 * drives Jx Studio in headless Chromium through `window.__jxAutomation`, and writes PNGs to the
 * manifest's `outDir`.
 *
 * The contract the manifest is written in is documented in `scripts/screenshots/README.md` and
 * enforced statically, without a browser, by `scripts/check-shot-contract.ts`.
 *
 * ```bash
 * bun run screenshots                  # all shots
 * bun run screenshots --only hero      # one shot (repeatable / comma-separated)
 * bun run screenshots --headed         # visible browser, for tuning shot definitions
 * bun run screenshots --force          # re-baseline: overwrite every image
 * bun run screenshots --reuse-server   # photograph an already-running dev server (interactive only)
 * CHROMIUM_BIN=/path/to/chromium bun run screenshots
 * ```
