// Enforces the level × placement matrix of specs/studio-ui-guidelines.md §12.1 (the levels
// Themselves are specs/studio.md §13.2).
//
// Every Studio command declares a containment level — what it acts on — and a set of `menus`
// Placements — where it renders. Each placement admits a fixed set of levels: `blockbar` is a
// Selection surface and nothing else; `commandbar/primary` takes application and document verbs
// Only; the status bar is three separate single-level placements rather than one "mixed" region.
// Mixed regions are mixed IN THE TABLE, so there are no prose exemptions to argue about in review.
//
// This is the check that stops the rail, the toolbar and the context menus re-accreting: without
// It, "position encodes scope" is a design memo, and the first PR under deadline pressure puts a
// Selection verb in the Command Bar because there was room.
//
// Run in the CI `checks` job: `bun scripts/check-command-levels.ts`
// Against a fixture:        `bun scripts/check-command-levels.ts --source <module.ts>`
//
// The source module exports `defaultCommandSet(): Command[]`. Today that is the studio's default
// Command set; when the app bootstraps its registry from more than one contribution point, this
// Script's default source becomes whatever module composes them — the check is unchanged.
