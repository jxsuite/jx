/**
 * Every version in `.release-please-manifest.json` must have actually shipped a GitHub release at
 * its tag.
 *
 * NOTHING ASKED THIS QUESTION BEFORE, and the answer was no for six weeks. Two independent ways to
 * lose a release, both of which exit 0:
 *
 * 1. Release-please drops a component whose changelog contains a raw `<tag>` (the defect written up in
 *    `commitlint.config.ts`). It logs "Pull request contains releases, but not for component:
 *    starters", creates the other 18, and succeeds. The manifest still says 1.5.0.
 * 2. The `release-please` job dies PART WAY THROUGH — a GitHub 5xx while it backfills file lists,
 *    which is exactly what a component with no tag provokes, because it forces a walk back through
 *    500 commits. Re-running the job then finds the pull request already labelled `autorelease:
 *    tagged`, so `releases_created` comes back `false` and `publish`, all four desktop bundlers,
 *    `nix-build` and `deploy-site` SKIP. A green run, no release.
 *
 * The visible damage from (1)+(2) was `@jxsuite/starters` sitting at 1.2.2 on npm while
 * `@jxsuite/create@1.3.2` and `@jxsuite/server@2.2.1` shipped declaring `^1.5.0` — so `npm install
 * @jxsuite/create` failed to resolve, for everyone, silently.
 *
 * This is the job that says so. It runs in `release-please.yml` with `if: always()`, so a crashed
 * or no-op release run still gets checked, and again on that workflow's daily schedule.
 *
 *     bun scripts/check-release-integrity.ts
 *
 * ## It deliberately does NOT ask npm, and there is evidence behind that
 *
 * It used to, and the registry probe was removed rather than made more patient. `npm publish`
 * printing `+ @jxsuite/ai@0.37.0` does not mean `npm view @jxsuite/ai@0.37.0` will find it: the
 * version's `time` entry in the packument is stamped when the registry finishes WRITING, and that
 * trails acceptance by up to three minutes, for a package or two per release, unpredictably. (On
 * the 2026-08-30 release: `connector` +76s, `site` +96s, `ai` +187s — and the other sixteen
 * packages in that same run were readable within a second.)
 *
 * So the probe filed an issue every time it raced a slow write. Every "Released versions that never
 * shipped" issue this repository has ever had, against when npm actually became readable:
 *
 *     #177  @jxsuite/ai@0.36.2         readable  39s AFTER the issue was filed
 *     #199  @jxsuite/connector@0.5.3   readable  36s AFTER the issue was filed
 *     #264  @jxsuite/ai@0.37.0         readable  82s AFTER the issue was filed
 *     #264  @jxsuite/site@1.1.0        readable   1s AFTER the issue was filed
 *
 * Nought for three: not one real catch, and three rounds of someone investigating a release that
 * was already fine. A detector whose every firing is noise teaches people to ignore the firing that
 * is not, which costs more than the check was ever worth.
 *
 * The release check is the half that had the value anyway. The six-week `starters` incident had NO
 * TAG AND NO RELEASE — not merely a missing publish — so this catches it. And it cannot fail the
 * way the npm probe did: `gh release view` is read-after-write consistent, so a 404 means the
 * release is genuinely absent rather than merely not replicated yet.
