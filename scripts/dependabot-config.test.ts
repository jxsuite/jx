/**
 * The dependency autopilot is configuration, and configuration is the kind of thing that fails
 * SILENTLY: a Dependabot entry pointed at the wrong directory, or naming an ecosystem that cannot
 * see this repository's lockfile, does not error — it simply never opens a pull request, and the
 * absence of pull requests looks exactly like "nothing to update". Every assertion below is a
 * condition under which Dependabot would go quiet rather than complain.
 *
 * It lives flat in `scripts/` rather than `scripts/ci/` for the same reason
 * `scripts/release-config.test.ts` does: it runs unconditionally via `bun test --isolate scripts`
 * in test.yml's `changes` job, and `scripts/ci/**` is in `affected.ts`'s GLOBAL list, so putting it
 * there would make editing dependency policy run the full workspace matrix.
 *
 * The policy this guards is written up in .github/AGENTS.md, "Dependency Autopilot".
