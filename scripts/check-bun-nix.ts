/**
 * `bun.nix` is a pure function of `bun.lock`, and nothing in CI ever said so.
 *
 * Bun2nix derives every dependency hash from the lockfile — no network, no store, no aggregate
 * `node_modules` hash to chase — so the committed `bun.nix` is stale exactly when someone changed
 * `bun.lock` without regenerating it. The root `postinstall` does that for a human running `bun
 * install` locally, and the devShell's `update-nix-hashes` does it on demand; a bot that edits the
 * lockfile does neither. Dependabot in particular has no hook that could.
 *
 * The only thing that ever noticed was `nix build` — a ~90 second job whose failure is a `bun
 * install` aborting against a 404 from the offline registry shim (packages/desktop/package.nix
 * explains that path). That is a true answer delivered slowly and in the wrong vocabulary. This is
 * the same answer in under a second, naming the packages that moved and the command that fixes it.
 *
 * IT IS NOT A BLOCKING GATE ON EVERY PULL REQUEST, on purpose. Under the dependency-autopilot
 * policy (.github/AGENTS.md) a Dependabot pull request merges with `bun.lock` moved and `bun.nix`
 * untouched — no bot can regenerate it on a Dependabot branch and have the result re-checked — so
 * `main` carries a lagging `bun.nix` between releases and a gate here would simply block every
 * dependency update. Three callers use it instead, each asking a different question:
 *
 * - `.github/workflows/nix.yml` runs `--fix` in the WORKING TREE before every build, so the Nix check
 *   on a pull request answers "does this dependency set build?" rather than "did a bot remember to
 *   run a generator?".
 * - `.github/workflows/release-bun-nix.yml` runs `--fix` on the release pull request and commits the
 *   result — the one branch where the file must be right, because that tree becomes the tag.
 * - Nix.yml's release leg runs it BARE. At `publish` time a drift is a failure, not a fixup: `nix run
 *   github:jxsuite/jx/release` reads the committed file.
 *
 * The generator is invoked as a SUBPROCESS rather than through its module export on purpose:
 * importing `bun2nix` runs `sade`'s `prog.parse(process.argv)` at import time, i.e. the CLI itself,
 * which prints a 289 KB Nix expression to stdout as a side effect of being imported. The wasm
 * binding underneath (`bun2nix/bun2nix-wasm.js`) has no such side effect but is a private path.
 * `bun2nix` the command is the interface the postinstall and the devShell already use, so it is the
 * one this agrees with.
 *
 *     bun scripts/check-bun-nix.ts        # the gate
 *     bun scripts/check-bun-nix.ts --fix  # regenerate bun.nix, then exit 0
