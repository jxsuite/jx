/**
 * The CI half of the changelog-safety gate. The rule, the reasoning, and the failure it prevents
 * are all in `commitlint.config.ts` — read that first; this file only applies it to a commit
 * range.
 *
 * Both halves exist because they fail at different moments and neither covers the other:
 *
 * - `.husky/commit-msg` runs commitlint as you commit. It is the fast feedback, and it is BYPASSABLE
 *   (`--no-verify`), which is how `feat(compiler): responsive images — <picture> …` reached `main`
 *   in the first place and quietly deleted `schema` and `starters` from three consecutive
 *   releases.
 * - This runs in the `checks` job over the pull request's own commits, where nothing can skip it.
 *
 * It reads the rule from `commitlint.config.ts` rather than restating it, so the hook and the gate
 * cannot drift into disagreeing about which subjects are safe.
 *
 * Merge commits are skipped: release-please cannot parse them as conventional commits (its log is
 * full of "commit could not be parsed: Merge pull request #…"), so their subjects never reach a
 * changelog and cannot trigger the defect.
 *
 *     bun scripts/check-changelog-safety.ts                       # origin/main..HEAD
