/**
 * The schema freshness gate, and the backfill lane that fixes what it finds.
 *
 * These assertions come in two halves, and the second is the important one. The first proves the
 * delta engine — the thing that turns a 500 KB JSON diff into "these pointers moved". The second
 * proves the WORKFLOW, because `.github/workflows/schemas.yml` pushes commits to pull request
 * branches and a workflow that is subtly wrong does not error, it just does the wrong thing quietly
 * to somebody's branch. Every assertion there is a condition under which the lane would either stop
 * fixing things or start fixing the wrong ones.
 *
 * It lives flat in `scripts/` for the same reason `dependabot-config.test.ts` does: it runs
 * unconditionally through `bun test --isolate scripts` in test.yml's `changes` job, and
 * `scripts/ci/**` is in `affected.ts`'s GLOBAL list, so putting it there would make editing CI
 * policy run the entire workspace matrix.
