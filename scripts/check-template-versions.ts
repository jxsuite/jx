/**
 * Every `@jxsuite/*` dependency range that ships inside a TEMPLATE must name the version that was
 * actually released.
 *
 * There are two such surfaces and neither is a workspace, so `bun install` never resolves them and
 * nothing kept them current:
 *
 * 1. `packages/starters/sites/*` — `@jxsuite/starters` PUBLISHES `sites/`, so these are the ranges a
 *    user's `bun install` resolves, and the ones Studio installs when it iterates a starter. They
 *    are not bun workspace members (the root globs are `packages/*`, `extensions/*`, `examples`,
 *    `sites/*`), so `workspace:^` is not available and a real semver range is required.
 * 2. `packages/create/template-versions.json` — the ranges `buildPackageJson()` stamps into every
 *    scaffolded project, INCLUDING starter clones, whose `package.json` it rebuilds from scratch.
 *
 * They had drifted past 1.0 entirely: `^0.19.0` for a compiler released at 1.5.0, and most starters
 * were no better. Every one of those ranges was unresolvable against anything published, so a
 * scaffolded project installed a toolchain that predates the template it came from — and Studio
 * greeted anyone opening a starter with an "Update @jxsuite packages?" modal, which is also what
 * was covering the canvas in four screenshot shots.
 *
 * WHO WRITES THESE. Not this script, in the normal case: release-please rewrites them inside its
 * own release commit via `extra-files` (release-please-config.json), so the tree `publish.yml`
 * packs from already carries the right ranges and this check is green on the release PR's first
 * run. `--fix` is for the drift that predates that, and for a template gaining a dependency.
 *
 * The source of truth is each workspace's own `package.json` version, which is the same number
 * release-please writes — so the invariant "range == ^<workspace version>" holds at every commit on
 * every branch, which is what makes this safe to block on.
 *
 *     bun scripts/check-template-versions.ts        # the gate
 *     bun scripts/check-template-versions.ts --fix  # rewrite the ranges, then exit 0
