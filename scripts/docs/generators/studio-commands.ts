// Generates the two registry-derived Studio reference pages:
//
//   Docs/studio/interface/commands.md   — every command record, by category
//   Docs/studio/interface/shortcuts.md  — every BINDING, by key scope
//
// Both are projections of one source: `appCommandSet()`, the bare-Bun-importable
// Command set the three CI checks already load. `src/commands/reference.ts` owns
// The row shapes and the tables; this file owns the frontmatter, the prose and
// The file identity. Generating both closes what was the last place the app's
// Keyboard and its documentation could disagree; like every generated page they
// Are build outputs, gitignored and never diffed (`pages.ts`).
