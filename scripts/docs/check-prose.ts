/**
 * Keep the documentation reading like a person wrote it.
 *
 * The vocabulary rules in the style guide worked: across 163,533 words this corpus has no hit for
 * delve, seamless, comprehensive, crucial, pivotal, "at its core" or "let's dive in", no decorative
 * horizontal rules, and no "Key takeaways" heading. What it had instead was punctuation, at a rate
 * no person writes: an em dash every forty-four words. So the bans below mostly guard ground that
 * is already clean, and the one number that is not yet zero is carried as debt.
 *
 * **Two tiers, and the difference is whether the target is zero.**
 *
 * A `ban` is a mark or a phrase that is wrong every time it appears, so it is simply forbidden and
 * an exception needs an allow entry saying why this instance is not what the rule is about. There
 * are eight of those today and each one is a fact about the world: a JS realm is a spec term, the
 * status glyphs in the locale table are the app's own, and the style guide has to be able to quote
 * the phrases it bans.
 *
 * A `budget` is a per-file count that may only fall. It is DEBT, not configuration. The count is
 * checked in both directions: above its entry fails, and below its entry also fails, because a
 * number left high after a file was fixed is a number nobody will lower later. Each rewrite deletes
 * its files' entries, and when the map empties the rule hardens into a ban.
 *
 * **That has now happened.** The em dash was carried as debt across 131 pages and reached zero, so
 * it is a ban and `budgets` is empty. The marketing pages and the package READMEs, the two surfaces
 * that were going to need the budget tier next, went straight to zero and joined the corpus as
 * bans. So nothing uses it today. It stays anyway, because the next rule with a rollout will want
 * it and because deleting a ratchet is how the campaign after this one ends up with a number nobody
 * lowers. Its tests run against a fixture instead of a real page, so a page reaching zero can no
 * longer break them.
 *
 * **What is deliberately not here.** Sentence length, `rather than`, `X, not Y.`, bold labels on
 * list items, forced triples, and the animated-software verbs (`names`, `carries`, `holds`) are all
 * measurable and none of them is gated. A budget on a cadence whose target is not zero asserts that
 * the fifth instance is wrong while the fourth was fine, which is not a claim anyone can defend at
 * review time; and the bold-label rule in particular would fire on about a thousand bullets whose
 * label is a real button the style guide REQUIRES to be bold. They are style-guide rules for a
 * person to apply, and `--report` prints their counts without failing anything.
 *
 * `rather than` is the one to watch, and the reason it is not gated is also the reason it needs
 * watching. Removing the em dashes pushed it from 212 to 240 and `X, not Y.` from 94 to 100,
 * because a dash and a contrast are the same gesture and the obvious substitution keeps the
 * gesture. No count is wrong; a page holding ten of them is. `--report` ranks by density so the
 * concentrations are visible, and thinning them is a read, not a check.
 *
 * Rules judge segments from `lib/prose.ts`, never raw lines, so a bare em dash in a table cell
 * stays the data value it is and a `:::doc-note` marker is not mistaken for a sentence.
 *
 * Usage: `bun scripts/docs/check-prose.ts [--report] [--ratchet] [paths…]`
