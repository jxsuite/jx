/**
 * Check-schema-freshness.ts — every committed schema build is what its generator produces.
 *
 * Two generators write JSON into this tree. `bun run generate:schema` writes the SEVEN core
 * artifacts under `packages/schema/` (the document schema, the project schema, the class schema,
 * the extension-manifest schema and the three `schemas/*.schema.json` fragments); `bun run
 * schema:generate-all` composes those into a `project.schema.json` and a `document.schema.json`
 * inside each of the 26 project roots. All 59 files are generated artifacts that happen to be
 * committed, because editors, `jx validate` and published npm packages all read them off disk.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND THE HOLE IT CLOSES. `schema:verify` used to be a shell one-liner:
 *
 *     generate:schema && git diff --exit-code -- packages/schema/schema.json &&
 *     schema:generate-all && git diff --exit-code -- '**\/project.schema.json' '**\/document.schema.json'
 *
 * Both pathspecs are narrower than the generators they follow. `packages/schema/schema.json` is one
 * of seven core outputs, and neither `packages/schema/project-schema.json` (a hyphen, not a dot)
 * nor `packages/schema/schemas/project.core.schema.json` nor `class-schema.json` matches
 * `**\/project.schema.json`. So the gate regenerated all seven, looked at one, and passed — with
 * the other six freshly rewritten and unread in the working tree. Measured, not inferred: stamping
 * `"title": "STALE MARKER"` into `class-schema.json` and running `bun run schema:verify` exits 0. A
 * stale `class-schema.json` is a `.class.json` contract that says something the code does not,
 * which is the same class of six-week silence that `check-shadowed-core.ts` was written for.
 *
 * So this derives the answer instead of naming files: it snapshots every tracked `*schema.json`,
 * runs both generators, and reports whatever moved. A generator that starts writing an eighth
 * artifact is covered on the day it does.
 *
 * A 500 KB JSON diff is not a review, so drift is reported as MEANING: the JSON Pointers that
 * appeared, vanished or changed value. `+42 /$defs/CssProperties/enum/anchorName…` is a sentence;
 * `git diff` on one line of minified `enum` is not. Primitive arrays are compared as SETS on
 * purpose — order in an `enum` or a `required` is not meaning, and index pointers would report one
 * insertion as a hundred changes.
 *
 *     bun run schema:verify   # the gate: regenerate, report drift, restore the tree, exit 1
 *     bun run schema:sync     # regenerate and KEEP the result, exit 0 — the fixer
 *
 * @docs extending/contributing/monorepo
 *
 * `.github/workflows/schemas.yml` runs `--fix` and commits what it produced, so a stale schema is
 * backfilled rather than being a red X somebody has to clear by hand. `checks` still runs the bare
 * gate: the lane cannot push to a fork, and a required check is what keeps a stale build off `main`
 * when it cannot.
