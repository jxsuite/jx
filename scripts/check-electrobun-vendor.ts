/**
 * `vendor/electrobun` is the Electrobun SDK's TypeScript sources, and this is the one thing that
 * puts them there and proves they are the right ones.
 *
 * Electrobun 2 publishes no SDK to npm. `node_modules/electrobun` is a CLI bootstrap whose
 * `exports` map sends every specifier — `electrobun`, `electrobun/main`, `electrobun/view`, types
 * and all — to a module whose entire body is `throw new Error(...)`. The sources reach a project
 * only when Hutch downloads that release's core archive and copies them into a gitignored
 * `.hutch/devkit`. That is a network step, so before this script existed a fresh `git clone && bun
 * install` could not typecheck `packages/desktop` at all, and CI had to run `electrobun prepare`
 * just to reach `tsc`.
 *
 * The submodule replaces that for typechecking AND for the one bundle Hutch does not compile: the
 * webview init script, which `packages/desktop/scripts/pre-build.ts` builds with plain `bun build`
 * through the same tsconfig `paths`. With the submodule absent that bundle silently inlines
 * `node_modules/electrobun`'s throwing stub, and desktop 5.0.0 through 5.1.3 shipped exactly that
 * from release lanes with a bare checkout. Hutch's `.hutch/devkit` remains the sysroot for Hutch's
 * own bundling of the main process, and the two agree by construction: the devkit is a verbatim
 * copy of the same five directories (196 of 197 files byte-identical at 2.0.1 — the exception is a
 * Linux-only null guard in `webGPU.ts` with no type surface). So the gate here asserts they name
 * the same RELEASE rather than the same bytes; demanding byte equality would fail on upstream's own
 * release-versus-tag slop, which is not ours to police. `--fix` reports those byte differences
 * anyway, because a growing list is the signal that the assumption stopped holding.
 *
 * The version has two writers — the `electrobun` devDependency pin and this submodule's gitlink —
 * so the gate is what keeps them together. A Dependabot bump moves the pin alone, goes red here,
 * and `bun run electrobun:sync` is the one-command follow-up.
 *
 *     bun scripts/check-electrobun-vendor.ts                # the gate
 *     bun scripts/check-electrobun-vendor.ts --init         # check out/sparsify/stub, then gate
 *     bun scripts/check-electrobun-vendor.ts --fix          # …and move to the pinned tag
 *     bun scripts/check-electrobun-vendor.ts --fix --soft   # …and never exit non-zero
 *
 * `--init` is what CI uses, and what `pre-build.ts` and every desktop bundle lane run before the
 * init bundle is compiled (`scripts/desktop-build-lanes.test.ts` holds the lanes to it). It
 * deliberately stops short of moving the gitlink, because moving it is exactly how a Dependabot
 * bump would stop looking like a mismatch — CI has to materialise the submodule to typecheck or
 * build at all, and still report the disagreement it was sent to find.
 *
 * `--fix --soft` is what the root `postinstall` uses: a contributor without the submodule should
 * get an actionable line, not a failed `bun install`. It also suppresses the drift report, which is
 * a note for someone who asked rather than something to print on every install.
