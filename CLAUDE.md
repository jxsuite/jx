# Jx Monorepo — Agent Notes

## Testing & Coverage Policy

Every workspace must keep full unit-test coverage — `packages/*` core packages and `extensions/*` extension packages (auth, connector, parser, search) alike. Enforcement has three layers:

1.  **Per-file coverage thresholds** live in each workspace's own `bunfig.toml` — `packages/<pkg>/bunfig.toml` and `extensions/<ext>/bunfig.toml` (`coverageThreshold = { lines = X, functions = Y }`). Bun enforces these **per file**, not as an aggregate — no single source file may fall below the bar. Keys must be plural (`lines`/`functions`); singular keys are silently ignored by Bun.
2.  **Manifest check** — `bun scripts/check-coverage-manifest.ts <workspace-dir>` (e.g. `packages/schema`, `extensions/auth`) fails if any `src/**/*.ts` file never appears in `coverage/lcov.info` (Bun only counts files imported during the run, so a brand-new untested file is otherwise invisible to thresholds). Type-only files are allowlisted inside the script.

    An absence is evidence, not a verdict: Bun 1.4.0 has been observed leaving a file out of the report that the same run demonstrably loaded and executed. So a missing file is not failed on sight — the script **re-runs coverage over just the tests that name it** and decides from that. Nothing loads it → still a failure, which is the regression the gate is for; it is exercised → the run's counts are held to the workspace's own `coverageThreshold`, so a rescued file stays gated rather than waved through. Naming a module is not loading it, so a `mock.module()` of an otherwise untested file cannot rescue it. If a rescue warning appears for a file **you** just added, the file is fine and Bun is not.

    **That defect has a known shape, and it is not about CI.** Bun 1.4.0 loses a source file's coverage record when **two or more dynamic `import()`s of it are in flight at once**. The module body still evaluates once and its exports work; only the record goes. `Promise.all([import(M), import(M)])` loses it and two sequential `await import(M)` do not, so the discriminator is overlap — not un-awaitedness, not scale, not the runner. `scripts/repro/bun-coverage-drop.sh` demonstrates it in four files with no jx code.

    A dropped file is **absent**, not reported at 0%, so no `coverageThreshold` can fire on it and the aggregate is computed as though it were not there. The manifest check is what stands in front of that, which is why it adjudicates rather than trusting the report.

    Practical rule when you write a test that invokes a command whose `run` lazily imports its implementation: **double the implementation with `mock.module()`**, as `commands-defaults.test.ts`, `context-menu.test.ts` and `settings-key-scope.test.ts` all do. It gives the test a witness — an un-awaited import settles after `run()` returns, so without a double there is nothing to assert against — and it keeps two real imports from ever overlapping.

3.  **CI** — `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs the per-workspace matrix: `bun test --isolate --coverage` (cwd = the workspace, so its bunfig applies) plus the manifest check, alongside an ungated `checks` job (lint, both typechecks, the studio guards, the docs and schema gates) and a gated `lens-mutants` job. The Bun version is pinned once in `.github/actions/setup-bun`; bump it together with re-baselining thresholds.

    The matrix is **derived**, not listed: the `changes` job runs `scripts/ci/affected.ts`, which reads the workspace graph via `scripts/lib/workspaces.ts` and emits the workspaces a diff can reach. Consequences for agents:
    - **Adding a workspace needs no CI edit** — but it must ship a `bunfig.toml` with a `coverageThreshold`, or `affected.ts` fails the run by name.
    - **A suite that reads a file outside its own workspace needs an entry in `EXTRA_EDGES`**, with the test file that proves it. Those anchors are `existsSync`-checked before any other job starts, so moving a cited test reds CI immediately.
    - Push to `main` and `workflow_dispatch` are never gated; only pull requests are.
    - `scripts/**` has no coverage workspace, so its tests run via `bun test --isolate scripts` inside the `changes` job — the gate proves itself before it gates anything. Put new script tests where that finds them.

Conventions:

- New source files must ship with tests in the same PR (the manifest check fails CI otherwise).
- **Ratchet**: when a PR meaningfully raises a workspace's worst-file coverage, raise that workspace's `coverageThreshold` to just below the new minimum. Lowering a threshold requires explicit justification in the PR description.
- Run tests only via `bun test --isolate` (plain `bun test` has known order-dependent failures and is unsupported).
- Studio tests: use the shared harness `packages/studio/tests/harness.ts` (lit rendering, state/tab resets, in-memory `StudioPlatform` mock, event helpers, happy-dom rect stubs). The first import of a DOM test file must be `./harness` or `./with-dom.js` — lit-html captures `document` at import time.
- `mock.module()` before importing the module under test; `await import()` afterwards for modules with import-time side effects. sharp and `electrobun/main` must always be mocked (sharp is unloadable on NixOS; `electrobun/bun` is a deprecated alias no source here imports).
- Check per-file coverage with `bun test --isolate --coverage` from the workspace directory (`packages/<pkg>` or `extensions/<ext>`); the table prints to stderr.

## The Electrobun SDK is vendored, and typechecking depends on it

Electrobun 2 publishes **no SDK to npm**: `node_modules/electrobun` is a command bootstrap whose `exports` map sends every specifier — `electrobun`, `electrobun/main`, `electrobun/view`, types included — to `lib/moved.cjs`, a module whose entire body is `throw new Error(...)`. The real SDK reaches a project only when Hutch downloads that release's core archive and copies it into a gitignored `.hutch/devkit`. That is a network step, so a clone could not typecheck `packages/desktop` at all and CI had to run `bunx electrobun prepare` before it could reach `tsc`.

So the SDK's TypeScript sources are vendored: **`vendor/electrobun`, a git submodule pinned to the exact release the `electrobun` devDependency names.** `packages/desktop/tsconfig.json` maps `electrobun/*` straight into `vendor/electrobun/package/src`.

- **`bun run electrobun:verify` is the gate; `bun run electrobun:sync` is the fixer** (`scripts/check-electrobun-vendor.ts`). The root `postinstall` runs the fixer softly, so an ordinary `bun install` leaves a working tree that typechecks. CI runs `--init`, which materialises and narrows the submodule but deliberately **does not move the gitlink** — moving it is exactly how a Dependabot bump would stop looking like a mismatch.
- **The version has two writers**, the pin and the gitlink, and the gate is what keeps them together. A Dependabot `electrobun` bump goes red here; `bun run electrobun:sync` then committing the moved gitlink is the whole follow-up.
- **Hutch still owns builds.** `.hutch/devkit` is the build sysroot, the submodule is the typecheck sysroot, and they are one release rather than two sources of truth — the projection is a verbatim copy of the same directories (196 of 197 files byte-identical at 2.0.1). The gate compares VERSIONS, not bytes, on purpose: upstream's release artifact and its git tag legitimately differ, and `--init` reports those byte differences without failing on them.
- **The checkout is sparse**, and that is load-bearing rather than thrift. Upstream interleaves ~40 `*.test.ts` with its sources and ships a `.md` among them; at a tracked path those would be collected by a root-level `bun test`, rewritten by `bun run format:md`, and globbed by `check-coverage-manifest.ts`. Narrowed to the five directories the entry points reach, it is 1 MB instead of 26 MB and none of that happens.
- **A tracked path is not ignored by anything implicitly.** oxlint walks the tree honouring `.gitignore` — which is what actually excludes `node_modules`, `dist` and the old `.hutch/devkit`, and why `.oxlintignore` is inert (oxlint's ignore file is `.eslintignore`, via `--ignore-path`, and the lint script passes neither). `vendor` therefore needs an explicit entry in **both** `.oxlintrc.json` and `.oxlintrc.typecheck.json`, plus `.oxfmtrc.json` and root `bunfig.toml`.
- **The Nix derivation is the fifth of those, and the one that cost a release.** `package.nix` takes the whole repository as `src`, so a tracked path is part of the tree whose NAR hash IS the store path `nix run github:jxsuite/jx/release` resolves — and `vendor/electrobun` is the one tracked path whose PRESENCE depends on how the tree was fetched. GitHub's tarball materialises the gitlink as an empty directory; nix's git-tree source for a checkout omits it. The submodule is uninitialised either way, so no build phase notices — but two empty directories are two NAR entries, and `desktop-v5.0.0` had two store paths for one commit. CI published `sq57vgab…` and every consumer asked for `671d1spz…`: the push succeeded, the closure was complete, and the cache was useless (#250). `src` now filters `vendor` so the two agree by construction, asserted in `electrobun-config.test.ts` and re-checked against a live `nix eval` on nix.yml's publish leg.
- **`.d.ts` remains impossible.** `TS4094` in the SDK's own `index.ts` blocks declaration emit, so `skipLibCheck` cannot help and `packages/desktop` keeps its own tsconfig. That carve-out is asserted, not just written down, in `packages/desktop/tests/electrobun-config.test.ts`.

## Dependency Autopilot

Dependencies update themselves and merge themselves. `.github/dependabot.yml` opens the pull requests, `.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml` hands each one to GitHub's auto-merge, and the `ci` required status check on `main` is the only thing that decides. Nothing in the chain relaxes a check — the design is "let the suite be the reviewer", so a broken update is a red X and a stalled pull request, and the answer to one is more test coverage rather than a carve-out.

Three ecosystems, deliberately NOT consolidated into one pull request. `multi-ecosystem-groups` exists and is the wrong trade here: `.github/**` reaches no test workspace while `bun.lock` is in `affected.ts`'s GLOBAL list, so merging them would make every action version bump pay for a full run of the test suite.

| Ecosystem        | Cadence          | Grouping                   | What one pull request costs       |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `github-actions` | daily (weekdays) | one group, everything      | `checks` only                     |
| `bun`            | daily (weekdays) | minor+patch / major, split | the full ~22-job matrix, plus Nix |
| `nix`            | weekly           | one group, all four inputs | the Nix build only                |

The `bun` entry is a SINGLE root entry and covers all 21 workspace manifests — Dependabot expands the root `workspaces` globs itself and rewrites every member's `package.json`. `directories: ["/packages/*"]` would be wrong: a sub-directory bun job resolves the same root `bun.lock` upward, which is the "overlap in directories" the documentation forbids, and produces duplicate pull requests.

### bun.nix lags between releases, on purpose

`bun.nix` is a pure function of `bun.lock`, so every bun update makes it stale by construction — and **no bot can fix it on the Dependabot branch**. A push made with `GITHUB_TOKEN` raises no `pull_request` event, so the new head gets zero check runs and could never satisfy a required check. That is measured, not assumed: PR #131 carries a `github-actions[bot]` commit whose head still reports `state=pending` with no checks at all.

So the invariant moved. `bun.nix` matches `bun.lock` **at every release**, not at every commit:

- `bun run nix:check` / `bun run nix:sync` (`scripts/check-bun-nix.ts`) is the ONE definition of "regenerate bun.nix" — shared by the devShell's `update-nix-hashes`, both workflows below, and the root `postinstall`. It names the packages that moved instead of leaving a 289 KB diff to read.
- `nix.yml` regenerates it **in the working tree** before every build, so the Nix check on a dependency pull request answers _does this dependency set build?_ rather than going red on a generator nobody could have run.
- `.github/workflows/release-bun-nix.yml` commits the regenerated file to the **release pull request** — the branch that becomes the tag, and one a human is already watching.
- `nix.yml`'s release leg (`publish: true`) runs the check BARE. A drift there is a failure, not a fixup: if the sync ever fails to land, the release build fails, `release` does not advance, and release-please opens an issue. A stale `bun.nix` cannot reach a user.

### The Nix build runs on the release pull request, and nowhere else in `ci`

`nix.yml` has no `on: pull_request` trigger. A path-filtered workflow can never be a required check — it leaves the check pending forever when it does not fire — so test.yml (which has no `paths:` filter, and must never grow one) owns the pull-request leg via `workflow_call`, and the `ci` aggregate requires it.

**It is gated on the branch, not on the diff**: `startsWith(github.head_ref, 'release-please--')`. It was gated on the derivation's inputs (`bun.lock`, `package.json`, `packages/desktop/**`), which is most Dependabot pull requests, and it is by far the slowest job in the workflow.

The cost of that is explicit and was accepted: **a dependency bump which breaks packaging no longer blocks its own auto-merge.** It surfaces one step later, on the release pull request, where `ci` still requires the job and a human is already reading the diff — and behind that, `nix.yml`'s release leg runs BARE, so a broken derivation still cannot reach a `nix run github:jxsuite/jx/release` user. `skipped` is green and `failure` is not, which is what makes a branch gate enough.

Consequences for agents:

- **`affected.ts` no longer decides anything about Nix.** `NIX_INPUTS`, `Decision.nixBuild` and the `gate_nix` output are gone; do not reintroduce a path list for it. The only path list left is `nix.yml`'s own `push: main` filter, and that one is a **cache** trigger, not a check — it keeps `main`'s cache warm for every PR to inherit.
- `flake.nix`, `flake.lock` and `bun.nix` stay in `affected.ts`'s `NO_TESTS`: no test suite reads them, so they must not fail open into the whole matrix either.

### Settings, not code

Two things live in repository settings and cannot be asserted from the tree:

1.  **Allow auto-merge** (Settings → General → Pull requests). Without it the mutation errors out.
2.  **A ruleset on `main`** requiring a pull request and the `ci` status check, enforced for everyone. This is load-bearing, not hygiene: `gh pr merge --auto` FAILS OPEN — with no required check it performs an ordinary merge instead, and it treats `UNSTABLE` (non-required checks red) as immediately mergeable. That is why the workflow calls the `enablePullRequestAutoMerge` mutation, which errors rather than merging, and asserts the ruleset exists before delegating to it.

No secret is involved. On a Dependabot event `secrets.*` resolves against the separate Dependabot store, so a secret referenced in that workflow would arrive as an empty string — a failure that reads like a malformed value rather than a missing one.

### Traps that are quiet rather than loud

- **`bun.lock` must stay at `lockfileVersion: 1`.** Dependabot's updater image pins Bun 1.3.14, which refuses version 2 — Bun 1.4's default for a lockfile written from scratch. The failure is `DependencyFileNotSupported`, i.e. bun updates simply stop arriving. `scripts/dependabot-config.test.ts` asserts this, along with everything else in this section that can be asserted from the tree.
- **A `GITHUB_TOKEN` merge starts no `push` workflows.** release-please and the Nix cache-warming build are both `push: main`, and auto-merge merges as `GITHUB_TOKEN` — so both now also run on a schedule. Without that the release pull request would silently stop picking up commits and the Actions cache on `main` would go cold.
- **A three-day cooldown applies to every version update** whether or not it is configured, and the days keys cannot be set to zero. `cooldown: { exclude: ["*"] }` is the documented lever for zero delay; it trades away the supply-chain quarantine, so it is not the default here.
- **Release-only workflows are unexercised.** `bundle-desktop-*`, `build-msix` and `publish` are `workflow_call`-only, so an action bump inside them is first executed during a real release. Accepted deliberately — that pipeline already fails loudly and opens issues — but it is the one place where a green `ci` does not mean "tested".
- **`@jxsuite/*` is ignored** for the bun ecosystem. release-please owns those ranges (it rewrites them inside the release commit via `extra-files`, and `bun run templates:check` gates them), so a Dependabot bump would be a second writer on the same line.

## Releases, and the two ways one silently does not happen

release-please owns every version, tag, changelog and npm publish (`release-please-config.json`, `.release-please-manifest.json`, `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`). Both of its failure modes exit 0, which is why each now has a gate.

### A raw `<tag>` in a commit subject deletes that package from its own release

release-please writes the release pull request body with changelog text HTML-escaped, then on merge parses that body and **re-serialises it** (`PullRequestBody.parse(...).toString()`) before parsing it a second time in `buildRelease()`. The round trip DECODES the entities, so `&lt;picture&gt;` comes back as a live `<picture>` element; node-html-parser then swallows the `</details>` that should have closed the section, the component is no longer found in the parsed release data, and release-please logs `Pull request contains releases, but not for component: <name>` and skips it — no tag, no GitHub release, no npm publish, green run.

`feat(compiler): responsive images — <picture> per format…` did exactly that: `schema` and `starters` fell out of three consecutive releases, and `@jxsuite/starters` sat at 1.2.2 on npm while `@jxsuite/create@1.3.2` shipped depending on `^1.5.0`, so `npm install @jxsuite/create` was unresolvable. The bug is upstream and still present in release-please 17.11.1, so the defence is to keep the text out of the changelog. **Backticks do not help** — the escaping happens on raw text.

- The rule and the full write-up live in `commitlint.config.ts` (`changelog-safe-angle-brackets`).
- `.husky/commit-msg` applies it as you commit; `checks` runs `bun scripts/check-changelog-safety.ts` over the pull request's commits, because a hook is skippable with `--no-verify` and that is how the subject landed.
- Only the **subject** and `BREAKING CHANGE:` notes are judged — nothing else reaches a changelog, so a commit body may still contain markup.

### A crashed `release-please` job disables the whole pipeline on the re-run

The job creates the GitHub releases first and builds the next pull request second. If it dies in between — a GitHub 5xx during its commit-history walk, which an un-tagged component provokes by forcing a 500-commit backfill — the releases exist but the run failed. **Re-running it is not idempotent in the way that matters**: the pull request is already labelled `autorelease: tagged`, so `releases_created` comes back `false` and `publish`, all four desktop bundlers, `nix-build` and `deploy-site` all skip. That is how `desktop-v2.2.0` shipped with no installers.

`verify-release-integrity` is the answer: `if: always()`, gated on nothing, it asserts every version in `.release-please-manifest.json` has a GitHub release at its tag (`bun run release:integrity`). It fails the run and opens ONE `release-incomplete` issue. Nothing `needs:` it, so a red X there blocks nothing else. The daily schedule on the workflow makes it a standing sweep.

To backfill npm after a skip, `publish.yml` has a `workflow_dispatch` entry point and is idempotent: `gh workflow run publish.yml -f paths_released='["packages/ai"]' -f sha=$(git rev-parse origin/main)`. Already-published versions are skipped, so running it when nothing was missing is a no-op.

### The gate does not ask npm, and that is a decision with evidence behind it

It used to, and the registry half was **removed rather than made more patient**. `npm publish` printing `+ @jxsuite/ai@0.37.0` does not mean `npm view @jxsuite/ai@0.37.0` will find it: the version's `time` entry in the packument is stamped when the registry finishes writing, and that trails acceptance by up to three minutes, for a package or two per release, unpredictably. On the 2026-08-30 release, `connector` was readable 76s after acceptance, `site` 96s, `ai` 187s — and the other sixteen packages in the same run were readable within a second.

So the probe filed an issue every time it raced a slow write. Every "Released versions that never shipped" issue this repository has ever had, measured against when npm actually became readable:

| Issue | Version                    | Readable                          |
| ----- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| #177  | `@jxsuite/ai@0.36.2`       | 39s **after** the issue was filed |
| #199  | `@jxsuite/connector@0.5.3` | 36s **after** the issue was filed |
| #264  | `@jxsuite/ai@0.37.0`       | 82s **after** the issue was filed |
| #264  | `@jxsuite/site@1.1.0`      | 1s **after** the issue was filed  |

Nought for three: not one real catch, and three rounds of someone investigating a release that was already fine. A detector whose every firing is noise teaches people to ignore the firing that is not, which costs more than the check was ever worth. **Do not add it back with a longer retry** — the lag is a property of the registry, unbounded from here, so any budget is a guess that turns a false red into a slower false red.

The release check is the half that had the value anyway. The six-week `starters` incident had **no tag and no release**, not merely a missing publish, so the surviving check catches it — and it cannot fail the way the npm probe did, because `gh release view` is read-after-write consistent: a 404 means the release is genuinely absent rather than not replicated yet.

What is no longer watched, and where it would surface instead: a run where release-please created the tags but `publish` skipped or failed. `publish` failing is a red job on its own; `publish` **skipping** (the `releases_created == false` re-run case) is now caught only by the missing GitHub release, which that same failure mode also produces.

## Starter Roots and the Shadowed Core

Iterating a starter inside Studio runs `bun install` in that starter's root, and a starter pins **published** `@jxsuite/*` versions because it is a template a user scaffolds from. The install therefore materialises a real `@jxsuite/schema` beside a workspace that is far ahead of it, and anything resolving from that root reads the published copy. This silently produced a starter entry schema narrower than the starter's own content for six weeks.

- **`bun run schema:generate-all` cleans first** (`schema:clean-roots` → `scripts/check-shadowed-core.ts --fix`). It removes only `node_modules/@jxsuite/*` and the stray lockfile; third-party dependencies stay, because the install is what makes the starter preview. A workspace **symlink** is never removed — that is `examples/`, a workspace member, and it is the correct answer.
- **Never put the cleanup in a starter's `package.json`.** `@jxsuite/starters` publishes `sites/`, so those manifests ship to users; a `postinstall` there would delete the dependencies they just installed. The monorepo has the workspace being shadowed, so the monorepo owns the cleanup.
- `packages/compiler`'s schema loader is independently hermetic — a first-party `*.json` schema resolves from the host or throws — so schema composition is safe regardless. The cleanup defends everything else that resolves normally.
- `bun run schema:verify` proves the committed core **and** all 52 per-project entry documents match their generators. `schema:validate-all` answers a different question (documents against schemas) and cannot see a stale schema.

## Stale schemas fix themselves

Every committed schema in this repository is a build output — the seven core artifacts `bun run generate:schema` writes under `packages/schema/`, and the `project.schema.json` / `document.schema.json` pair `bun run schema:generate-all` composes into each of the 26 project roots. They are committed because editors, `jx validate` and every published `@jxsuite/schema` consumer read them off disk, not because anybody authors them. So the policy is the screenshot policy: **a generator produces the bytes, and you review the meaning.**

- **`bun run schema:verify` is the gate** (`scripts/check-schema-freshness.ts`), and **`bun run schema:sync` is the fixer.** The gate regenerates, reports drift as the JSON Pointers that moved, and puts the working tree back exactly as it found it; `--fix` leaves the result on disk. Never hand-edit a committed schema — the fix belongs in the generator or the source it reads.
- **The file set is DERIVED, not listed.** It is every tracked `*schema.json`. The gate this replaced was a shell one-liner whose two `git diff` pathspecs were each narrower than the generator they followed: it regenerated all seven core artifacts and looked at ONE, so a stale `class-schema.json`, `project-schema.json` or `schemas/project.core.schema.json` passed green. Verified by stamping a marker into `class-schema.json` and watching the old `schema:verify` exit 0.
- **`.github/workflows/schemas.yml` backfills it**, exactly as `screenshots.yml` does for pictures: it regenerates on every pull request, pushes the result to the branch, and posts one comment saying which pointers moved. Four things differ from that lane deliberately — no `paths:` filter (the whole job is under 30 seconds), Dependabot is **not** excluded (a `@webref/*` bump rewrites the core schema by construction, and there is no human on that branch), no `github.actor` refusal (the generators are deterministic, so the run its own push triggers pushes nothing — termination is a fixed point, not a guard), and a changed schema is **not** neutral, because a contract change is exactly the kind of thing a reviewer must read.
- **The trunk leg is not decoration.** Two branches can each be green alone and stale together: one moves the core, the other adds or regenerates a project root before it lands. Git merges that without a conflict, no per-branch check can see it, and `main` is stale from the second merge onward. `main` requires a pull request, so the lane opens one on a single reused `chore/schema-drift` branch. When the report says _nothing in this diff explains it_, that is what happened.
- **`schema:verify` stays a hard red X in `checks`** even though the lane fixes the same drift. The lane cannot push to a fork, and a required check is what keeps a stale schema off `main` when it cannot. The red X naming the problem and the lane fixing it is the intended sequence, not a duplicate.

## Specs & User-Documentation Policy

Specs (`/specs`, §-numbered) are the source of truth; user docs (`/docs`, published at jxsuite.com/docs) must track shipped behavior. Every plan for a behavior-changing task MUST include a "Specs & docs" step, and the change set must land code, spec edits, and docs-page updates together.

- **Before implementing**: consult the relevant spec; update it first when the user's request changes contracts (AGENTS.md rule). Edit spec sections IN PLACE — never renumber or remove numbered headings; docs `spec:` frontmatter anchors them and `bun run docs:check` fails on broken anchors.
- **Every substantive spec edit is a release**: run `bun run spec:bump <spec.md> <major|minor|patch|stable> -m "<what changed>"` — it advances the header + footer version, restamps `**Updated:**`, and prepends a `## Changelog` entry. Then `bun run docs:generate`. `bun run docs:spec-release` blocks in CI when a spec's _body_ changed without a version bump (body = everything but the version/`Updated:`/changelog/footer lines; header and section `Status:` markers count as body). `major` = breaking contract change, `minor` = additive, `patch` = editorial, `stable` = graduate 0.x → 1.0.0. **All specs are pre-1.0**, and at `0.x` the release-please `bump-minor-pre-major` policy applies: `major` moves the minor, `minor`/`patch` both move the patch. Versions and changelogs were reconstructed from git history (anchor-space diff per commit), so entries carry commit SHAs. The `-draft` suffix is derived from `**Status:**` (only non-`Implemented` specs carry it), never chosen by hand. The next version is computed from the higher of the working file and the same spec on `origin/main`, so a branch forked before a release cannot re-mint a version main already used — `spec:bump` says so when the base moves the answer, and `--base <ref>` overrides. Format contract: `specs/README.md`.
- **Find what a change affects**: `bun run docs:sync` maps the working diff to the docs pages/spec sections associated with the changed source files (via docs `code:` frontmatter and `@docs <slug>` tags in code). A Stop hook and a pre-commit advisory run the same check; treat the report as a prompt to update or to state explicitly that no update is needed (pure refactors).
- **Docs conventions**: pages carry `title` + `description ≤155 chars` and optionally `spec:`/`code:` frontmatter; every page needs a `docs/nav.json` entry (CI enforces bijection); `:::doc-note/tip/warning` callouts, `:kbd[...]` keys; style guide lives at `docs/extending/contributing/docs.md`.
- **Generated pages** (formula catalog, operators, protocol routes, starters, implementation status, spec changelog) are regenerated via `bun run docs:generate` — never hand-edited; CI diffs them. Adding routes/formulas/operators, or releasing a spec, means regenerating in the same PR.
- **Tag new public behavior**: add `@docs <slug>` to the implementing source file and list the file in the page's `code:` frontmatter so future changes trigger the sync check. `@since` is available for versioned additions.
- **Standards citations**: every spec with numbered headings carries a `## N. Standards Alignment` table naming each external standard it binds, its conformance class, the section it binds, and committed evidence — the contract is `specs/standards.md`, the gate is `bun run docs:standards`, and the derived page is `docs/extending/reference/standards.md`. A `Pending` row is how a missing standard becomes a tracked gap; its tier is derived from the bound section's `> **Status:**` marker, so "is it built" still has one source of truth. `scripts/docs/standards.json` is the lexicon of citable identifiers and only shrinks in the stale direction. A standard whose owning section does not exist yet cannot be a `Pending` row — it goes on the **adoption backlog** (`specs/standards.md` §11), which names the spec that will own it, so nothing identified is lost between audit and design.
- **The standards adoption program** — the multi-PR effort that built the registry and closed the gaps it found — is finished, and its plan document was deleted. The live state is the generated page (`docs/extending/reference/standards.md`, gaps by tier) and the backlog in `specs/standards.md` §11; the decisions it took that still bind (light DOM by default, `$shadow` opt-in only, breaking changes acceptable pre-1.0) are recorded in the specs they concern. Pick up a `gap:` id from the generated page, and read the row's note before designing.
- **Visual editors damage specs.** A round trip through a WYSIWYG Markdown editor escapes `## 18.` as `## 18\.` and flattens `[<id>](<url>)` to bare text and `**bold**` to plain. The escape is cosmetic and `bun run format:md` removes it (`bun run docs:markdown` fails on it in CI); the flattening is **unrecoverable** and needs `git show <last-good>:<file>`. Both are the same event, so treat a `heading-escaped` report as a prompt to check the file's links and bold survived.
- **Markdown source is not wrapped.** The rule is one paragraph per line in every tracked `.md` — `docs/`, `specs/`, every README, the starters, this file. A source-wrapped file fights the editor's own soft wrap, and editing a wrapped paragraph re-flows every line after the edit, so a one-word change arrives as a five-line diff. `bun run format:md` fixes a file. The engine (`scripts/lib/unwrap-prose.ts`) parses with the same remark stack that renders the pages — GFM, frontmatter and directives — and joins line breaks only inside a `paragraph` node, then edits the source by offset rather than re-serialising the tree, so a table, a fence or a `:::` marker is safe by construction rather than by a rule somebody remembered. Oxfmt's `proseWrap` stays `preserve`: its `never` folds a `:::doc-note` marker into the paragraph under it and unpads every table.
- **The rule is dormant, and turning it on is three steps.** The sweep is ~80 files and 6,500 deleted lines, so it conflicts with every open pull request and was deliberately not landed with the tool. `docs:markdown` and the nano-staged `*.md` hook both pass `--no-wrap`, so neither CI nor a commit rewrites anybody's Markdown today. To finish it: run `bun run format:md`, commit the result, and delete `--no-wrap` from the two `package.json` strings that carry it (`scripts.docs:markdown` and `nano-staged["*.md"]`). `specs/README.md` documents the header block and should gain the `\` markers in the same change.
- **A line break that means something is written `\`.** Three survive the pass: a hard break the author wrote (a trailing `\`, or two trailing spaces, which are rewritten to `\` because an invisible break is one an editor silently eats); a **labelled run**, two or more consecutive lines that each open with a bold key, which is what a spec's `**Version:** / **Status:** / **Updated:** / **License:**` header is and which the formatter marks for you; and a line whose whole content is one text directive (`:span[…]{…}`), which is a block in intent and gets no marker, because a `<br>` between two blocks would be a rendering change. Three gates were made wrapping-agnostic ahead of the sweep so it cannot mint releases: `spec-status.ts` reads header values up to the `\`, `spec-bump.ts` preserves the marker on a line it rewrites, and `check-spec-release.ts` unwraps both sides before comparing.
- **Docs prose has house rules, and the em dash is a BAN rather than a budget.** `bun run docs:prose` enforces eight of them over a specific corpus — `docs/**` minus generated pages, the shipped `README`s, and the marketing pages — and `prose.json` budgets nothing, so one `—` in a docs page is a red CI check. `specs/**` and this file are deliberately outside that corpus and keep their own voice, which is exactly why the two read differently. Rewrite an em dash away rather than substituting a different dash: a colon when a list follows, a full stop when it is joining two sentences, a comma or parentheses when the clause is subordinate. Both `.claude/hooks/` hooks now run this locally — per edit and again at Stop — so it should reach you before CI does.
- **Gates**: `bun run docs:check` (associations), `bun run docs:verify` (generated-page drift, clean tree only), `bun run docs:standards` (the alignment tables), `bun run docs:prose` (the prose rules above), `bun run docs:links` (link and anchor targets), `bun run docs:markdown` (visual-editor escapes; wrapping once `--no-wrap` goes) — all must stay green. `checks` runs every one of them; running only the four this line used to name is how seven em dashes reached CI.

## Screenshot Policy

Screenshots are never hand-taken and never hand-committed. `docs/images/` and `scripts/screenshots/capture.lock.json` are written only by `bun run screenshots`, which stamps each image's origin; an image whose hash is absent from the lock fails `docs:check`, and a docs page may only reference an image the lock names.

The shot contract (`scripts/screenshots/README.md`, designed in `packages/studio/UX-REDESIGN-PLAN.md` §13) governs what a shot may say, and `bun scripts/check-shot-contract.ts` enforces it on every PR with no browser, in seconds. Two rules decide every judgement call:

1. **A shot may name inputs the app accepts; never values the app derives.** Deltas (`toggle*`), screen coordinates and rendered text are all derived. The manifest contains no CSS or XPath selector, no `wait: {ms}`, and no `toggle*` command id — each is a committed budget that may only ratchet down.
2. **The pipeline may only ask the app to do sooner what the plan already commits to.** Nothing exists in `src/` solely to be photographed. If a shot needs a capability that fails this test, the shot is deleted or replaced by prose — never by a line of application code. A compatibility branch kept alive "so the screenshot manifest keeps working" is a defect.

Two CI lanes, because _the pipeline broke_ and _the documentation is now wrong_ are different events with different owners:

- **`check-shot-contract.ts`** runs on every PR in the `checks` job. It is red when a shot names a command, panel or region the app no longer declares — in the PR that renamed it, naming both sides.
- **The `screenshots` lane** runs on any PR touching `packages/studio/src/**`, `scripts/screenshots/**` or `packages/starters/**`, plus nightly. Its failure mode is a **bot commit, not a red X**: it re-captures, pushes the images and the lock to your branch, and comments with a before/after table and **the docs pages each changed image appears on**. It goes red only on a shot _error_ — a failed `expect`, an unknown id, an unresolvable region, an `idle()` timeout. A picture merely changing is an aesthetic judgement CI cannot make.

**You review pictures and prose; the lane produces bytes.** When the lane reports a changed image, re-read the pages it lists — a moved surface usually means the paragraph beside it is stale too, and no check will ever say so. A screenshot of content the docs pipeline already generates is a bug: every phase asks which shots it can delete before asking which it must re-author.

## Marketing & Claims Policy

Marketing copy (`sites/jxsuite.com/pages/**`) and `README.md` are gated by `bun run docs:claims` (blocking in CI and `deploy-site.yml`). The rule: a claim may only exist if it is (a) removed, (b) qualitative and clean of the forbidden patterns, or (c) pattern-matched **and** carries an allow entry in `scripts/docs/claims.json` whose `evidence` points at a test, a generated source, or a spec anchor whose status is `Implemented`. Reword the copy and the allow entry goes stale, so CI fails until it is re-justified.

- **New numbers need committed evidence.** Never introduce a performance, price, or scale figure (`<1s`, `100/100`, `$0/mo`) without a committed measurement or an allow entry explaining why it is illustrative. Measured numbers come from a benchmark, not from memory.
- **Download links / installer claims** derive from `packages/desktop/release-assets.json` — the single source of truth for asset filenames and their `signed` status. Only assets marked `signed: true` may be described as signed or notarized.
- **Non-mechanizable review items** (checked by hand): Studio-availability phrasing must match `docs/start/install.md` (the desktop app is the only end-user path to the visual editor; browser Studio is a repo-contributor workflow); avoid superlatives ("the only…", "fastest") the checker can't verify.
