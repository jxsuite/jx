/**
 * Mounts.ts — the asset mounts the refactor engine resolves rooted references through.
 *
 * A rooted reference (`/images/hero.jpg`) is a site URL, and an extension may claim a slice of that
 * URL space and serve it out of a directory of its own (specs/extensions.md §8.5). So "which file
 * does this URL name?" cannot be answered from the project root alone, and neither the read pass
 * nor the write pass can be correct without the mount list.
 *
 * **The engine loads them rather than taking them.** The format registry is passed in by every
 * caller because every caller already has one; nobody has a mount list, and there are four hosts
 * (two dev-server routes, the desktop project session, the cloud gateway). An option four hosts
 * each have to remember is an option three of them eventually do not — and a lane that silently
 * fails to resolve is precisely the defect this module exists to close (issue 239). `mounts` stays
 * available on both option types for a host that already has the list, and for tests.
 *
 * **Project-relative, filtered.** `loadAssetMounts` hands back whatever directory an extension
 * declared, which is normally absolute; `asset-paths.ts` documents its mount parameter as
 * project-relative. Rebasing here is that conversion, and a mount resolving OUTSIDE the project is
 * dropped: its files are not addressable by a project-relative path, so no rename can reach them
 * and no reference to them can be counted. `projectPathsForSiteUrl` declines the same case by
 * name.
 *
 * That drop is deliberate and is not the near half of a bug. A collection's `source` may point
 * outside the project (site-architecture.md §9.3), and its media renders — the compiler and the dev
 * server both publish it at the mount URL — but the editing host's file API is project-scoped by
 * containment check, so no surface can list, open or ask about the file either. Nothing therefore
 * reports a confident zero about it, which is the failure the lane math exists to prevent. Reaching
 * such a file means giving it a mount-relative identity in that file API, not widening this filter;
 * see §9.3, which records the decision (issue 244).
