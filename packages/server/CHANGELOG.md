### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **schema,site:** `@jxsuite/schema` no longer exports `./routes`, `./layout`, `./context` or `./head-merger`. Import them from `@jxsuite/site`; the modules and their behaviour are unchanged.

### Features

* **import:** limit the breakpoints an import keeps, and strip the classes it cannot use ([9ac5b60](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/9ac5b600a0b6834bb031daa64e1283ab51346cff))
* **import:** the site-import workflow, end to end ([eab1109](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/eab1109e0fc21a5f311d2f1c8f90626c1d51c55d))
* Open in Browser previews the working tree through the runtime ([b02e0e5](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/b02e0e543016879c963810f770b568995023e6ed))
* **server,studio:** the import stream says what the run found, and can check its own fidelity ([2e4c0e3](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/2e4c0e3dd1b63aead94bb70379c7ad8738420fd8))
* **server:** the working tree, browsable at real routes, on its own origin ([eaaafe3](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/eaaafe319b12a251b7da1e6b2375a1aa0d56bea2))
* **studio:** choose a format on New File, convert between formats, and inherit a collection's ([1c1061b](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/1c1061b95a66cc5e73aaf73d3605c0e7a285e086))
* **studio:** Open in Browser previews the canvas, and Build Site keeps the compiler ([9c45d21](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/9c45d219f2c55740ded4299fc4a75c3852878787))

* **studio:** the site import is an agent turn — model, brief, live status, and a pause to ask ([775abee](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/775abeeb20a4f1a727072ea60191c32bea5d0d9f))
* **studio:** watch an import in the project, in a feed that outlives the run ([509a1fd](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/509a1fdb313b26971bfffbd97a600f67999509e7))


### Bug Fixes

* **desktop,import:** the two gates the live preview left red, and the coverage it owed ([72657b7](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/72657b7c636d63aecb831378e5f16e134b062adb))
* **screenshots:** stop the screenshot lane churning, and fix the three defects underneath it ([1eb0e45](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/1eb0e45c0a3a1ca14859f0cf0dc322a4619eff51))
* **server,desktop:** answer a directory listing in stable path order ([8e7f314](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/8e7f3147bc9c4f91093066a5568459dfe0dcb4a7))

* **studio:** stop stripping the project root off a reply that is already in it ([de84180](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/de84180d9225029e18dcebe25a352f550e309f79)), closes [#239](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/issues/239)
* **studio:** the Packages table shows each dependency's own npm latest ([a90e170](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/a90e170392398c93926d94e092d7ec9ebe9b83e6))

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/compare/server-v2.2.7...server-v3.0.0) (2026-08-26)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **server:** a project relying on root-relative static serving loses it. The root lane survives as a COMPATIBILITY lane and is scheduled for removal; until then a site URL answered from it prints a diagnostic naming the file and the fix — move it into `public/`.

### Bug Fixes

* **server:** public/ resolves before the project root, as a build does ([2c123c6](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/2c123c6f09793311d6b99af2e59913bccdbf0cee))

## [2.1.0](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/compare/server-v2.0.0...server-v2.1.0) (2026-08-19)


### Features

* **auth:** a loopback redirect with PKCE, and cookies a browser will keep ([053f67c](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/053f67cf94216020dd2a39982cea30b3802ba3aa))
* **collab:** negotiate the wire envelope on the handshake — jx.collab.v1 ([5db8ae8](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/5db8ae8b781a1b5aeffbdd8f27cdf4c08ebb4540))
* **protocol:** one failure shape — RFC 9457 problem details ([2ab94b1](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/2ab94b189e1c1265f90713e36b8cb8030f9afd40))

* **server:** the live-reload stream reconnects, and the import stream stops hiding drops ([af72f6f](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/af72f6f20f54d332434dd3550818ffc8d61f497d))
* **studio,server,desktop:** P4 wave A — the app can say what happened ([98a4a3a](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/98a4a3a1f895981ebc0b06483ef31953d8ebf7ef))

### Bug Fixes

* **parser:** localized content never reached its own locale's asset mount ([179311b](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/179311b3f56d001eea37c092d73956c20056c55d))
* **server:** give the previewed site its own origin, so Open in Browser is the real site ([90eb4b4](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/90eb4b4b3eba897a1028fa5a4029ef0dcae61f88))
* **studio:** the icon I deleted, the two I never fixed, and the checker that approved all three ([7452caa](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/7452caa09312674b523588c991d05116c8bc41f4))

### Reverts

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/compare/server-v1.3.0...server-v2.0.0) (2026-07-30)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **studio:** `StudioPlatform` implementations must declare `createDestination` and honor `createProject`'s `destination`. `POST /__studio/create-project` rejects a request without one, and returns an absolute `root` for projects created outside the server root.

### Features
