/**
 * Popover correctness rules — one implementation, shared by every surface that judges a document.
 *
 * The HTML Popover API is expressed in Jx entirely through `attributes` and nested `style` keys, so
 * nothing in the toolchain had an opinion about it and three shipped sites drifted into three
 * different wrong answers. These rules are that opinion, and they live in `@jxsuite/schema` because
 * they are facts about a document TREE — no DOM, no renderer, no cascade — which is what lets the
 * Studio's Problems report, `jx build` and the starter conformance test all reach them without any
 * of the three depending on the other two.
 *
 * Two findings here are not intuitions; they are the two defects that actually shipped:
 *
 * 1. **`display` in a popover's base rule.** The UA sheet hides a closed popover with
 *    `[popover]:not(:popover-open) { display: none }`. That rule is UA-origin, so ANY author
 *    `display` beats it at any specificity, and the panel is laid out on every page whether open or
 *    not — usually parked off the side of the viewport by the `transform` that was meant to animate
 *    it. Nothing looks wrong until you scroll sideways or read the page with a screen reader.
 * 2. **`popovertarget` on an `<a>`.** `popovertarget` and `popovertargetaction` come from the
 *    `PopoverTargetAttributes` IDL mixin, which HTML includes into `HTMLButtonElement` and
 *    `HTMLInputElement` and into NOTHING else. On any other element they parse and do nothing. They
 *    look like they work because a link inside an open popover dismisses it by navigating away — an
 *    alibi that fails for `target="_blank"` and for a same-document `#hash`, both of which exist in
 *    the fleet today.
