 * string: explicit structured function declaration, mirroring ESTree's `BlockStatement.body =
 * Statement[]`. Every statement kind reuses a web-platform name: bare expression nodes (§19), the
 * JSON Schema 2020-12 `if`/`then`/`else` keyword triple, the element-level `$switch`/`cases`
 * convention in statement position, and WHATWG's `dispatchEvent` with `CustomEventInit` members,
 * `stopPropagation` and `preventDefault`.
