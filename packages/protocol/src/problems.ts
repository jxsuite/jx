/**
 * The Jx problem-type registry — the failure counterpart of `STUDIO_ROUTES`.
 *
 * A problem type is a URI a client can key on, and a URI nobody wrote down is a string each backend
 * spells differently. So the types live here, in one table, in the same idiom as the route table:
 * declared once, exported as data, rendered into the docs by the same generator, and checked by the
 * same drift machinery.
 *
 * **What belongs here.** A type is a _class_ of failure a client might handle differently — not a
 * message. "The project root was refused" is a type; "root /x/y was refused" is a `detail`. If two
 * entries would only ever differ in their wording, they are one type.
