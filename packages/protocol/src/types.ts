   * used to work. `cf_upstream_error` is the third case and deliberately arrives WITH `configured:
   * true`: Cloudflare being briefly unreachable is not a reason to send someone round an OAuth flow
   * that fixes nothing.

 * Cloudflare connection state (see StudioPlatform.cfConnection).
 *
 * Three answers, not two, and a reader tells them apart by SHAPE:
 *
 * - `null` — no credential and no row exists at all; nothing was ever connected here.
 * - `{connected: false}` — a credential exists but the provider rejected it. That is the dev server's
 *   stored-token-invalid case, and the publish panel's "Replace token" branch keys on it.
 * - `{connected: true, needsReconnect: true}` — a brokered row exists whose OAuth grant has lapsed.
 *   Its access token is gone or unrenewable, so every Cloudflare call will fail until the user goes
 *   back through the hosted flow.
 *
 * Each platform emits a strict subset: **cloud never emits `{connected: false}`** (a broker row it
 * cannot use is a reconnect, not a bad token) and **the dev server never emits `needsReconnect`**
 * (it holds a pasted token, not a grant, so there is nothing to lapse). Collapsing the lapsed case
 * into a healthy one is precisely the defect that let the connect popup close over a dead row while
 * the user was still typing their Cloudflare password.
