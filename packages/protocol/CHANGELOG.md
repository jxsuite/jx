### Dependencies

* The following workspace dependencies were updated
  * dependencies
    * @jxsuite/schema bumped to 2.0.0

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/compare/protocol-v1.2.1...protocol-v2.0.0) (2026-08-26)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **studio,desktop:** StudioPlatform's `saveSettings` is replaced by `patchSettings`, which takes a set/remove patch and answers with the resulting store. It stays optional, so an adapter that implements neither degrades to cache-only rather than throwing.

### Features

* **protocol:** type what an upload answers, and what a backend will accept ([8192345](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/819234555b3b37b5ce21d71005fc4f2cb05aae62))

### Bug Fixes

* **studio,desktop:** settings are patches, and a blank field never deletes ([76846af](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/76846afc28d81ff16e284fbe0b12d1f47cb604bc))

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **studio:** `StudioPlatform` implementations must declare `createDestination` and honor `createProject`'s `destination`. `POST /__studio/create-project` rejects a request without one, and returns an absolute `root` for projects created outside the server root.

### Features

* **studio:** require a user-chosen destination for new projects ([e08966c](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/e08966cc2d7a7ba34d4b12f3a6186396539b07da))
