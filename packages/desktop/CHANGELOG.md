## [5.0.0](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/compare/desktop-v4.0.0...desktop-v5.0.0) (2026-08-27)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **schema,site:** `@jxsuite/schema` no longer exports `./routes`, `./layout`, `./context` or `./head-merger`. Import them from `@jxsuite/site`; the modules and their behaviour are unchanged.

### Features

* **desktop:** both launchers can preview the working tree live ([5a7b816](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/5a7b8161252770d2f694bdd8c94e144c91f692cf))

### Bug Fixes

* **desktop,import:** the two gates the live preview left red, and the coverage it owed ([72657b7](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/72657b7c636d63aecb831378e5f16e134b062adb))
* **screenshots:** stop the screenshot lane churning, and fix the three defects underneath it ([1eb0e45](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/1eb0e45c0a3a1ca14859f0cf0dc322a4619eff51))
* **server,desktop:** answer a directory listing in stable path order ([8e7f314](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/8e7f3147bc9c4f91093066a5568459dfe0dcb4a7))
* **server,studio:** findReferences answers about every reference, and the rename keeps its promise ([84e558f](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/84e558f67abe9524e2895f0e9045fb6ad14a0981))
* **server:** resolve rooted refs through every lane, and index refs by shape ([29d3271](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/29d32716fb3c35e2e37235d4091739d950c2693a)), closes [#239](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/issues/239)

### Code Refactoring

* **schema,site:** site composition gets its own package ([f9d270d](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/f9d270daf261eef9ac9566192787b7a4bba25135))

## [4.0.0](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/compare/desktop-v3.0.1...desktop-v4.0.0) (2026-08-26)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **studio,desktop:** StudioPlatform's `saveSettings` is replaced by `patchSettings`, which takes a set/remove patch and answers with the resulting store. It stays optional, so an adapter that implements neither degrades to cache-only rather than throwing.

### Features

* **protocol:** type what an upload answers, and what a backend will accept ([8192345](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/819234555b3b37b5ce21d71005fc4f2cb05aae62))
* **studio:** declare assetSpace, and resolve media in the canvas realm ([196d259](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/196d2596b337e6298d2f0c15e984a5f29f7abe92))

* **studio,desktop:** settings are patches, and a blank field never deletes ([76846af](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/76846afc28d81ff16e284fbe0b12d1f47cb604bc))

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/compare/desktop-v1.2.1...desktop-v2.0.0) (2026-07-30)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **studio,server,desktop:** dev server bypassed the build; Monaco still loaded at startup ([288fb73](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/288fb73a0aae78318f17a4d1a24a73e0a523104e))
