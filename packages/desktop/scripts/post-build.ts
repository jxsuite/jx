/**
 * Electrobun postBuild hook: verify the staged bundle.
 *
 * Hook contract (unchanged across the Electrobun 2 migration): cwd = packages/desktop, env carries
 * ELECTROBUN_BUILD_DIR / ELECTROBUN_OS / ELECTROBUN_ARCH, and a non-zero exit fails the build. All
 * verification logic lives in verify-bundle.ts so it stays unit-testable; this runner only locates
 * the app dir. Runs under Hutch's runtime (Cottontail), so it stays on portable APIs.
 *
 * This used to chain embed-windows-icon.ts, which re-embedded icon.ico into launcher.exe and
 * bun.exe because Electrobun 1.18.1's own step resolved rcedit against a path baked into the
 * upstream CI machine and silently no-opped. Electrobun 2 embeds the configured `build.win.icon`
 * itself, so the workaround was deleted rather than left to run twice.
