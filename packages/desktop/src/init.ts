 * init.ts — Webview initialization for JSONsx Studio desktop app

 * 1. Creates the DesktopPlatform adapter (connects RPC to Bun process)
 * 2. Registers it as the active platform via the PAL

 * The studio's index.html loads this script before the main studio bundle.
 *
 * See spec/desktop.md §3.3 for the registration pattern.
