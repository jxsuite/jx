  # `vendor/electrobun` is a git submodule carrying the Electrobun SDK's TypeScript sources — what
  # `packages/desktop/tsconfig.json` typechecks against, and what no phase below reads. Nothing here
  # initialises it, so its CONTENT is absent either way. Its DIRECTORY is not: GitHub's tarball, the
  # thing `github:jxsuite/jx/release` actually fetches, materialises the gitlink as an empty
  # `vendor/electrobun`, while nix's git-tree source for a plain checkout — what CI builds — has no
  # `vendor` entry at all. Two empty directories are still two NAR entries, so ONE commit produced
  # TWO store paths: `671d1spz…` for the consumer, `sq57vgab…` for CI. The release pushed the second.
  # `nix path-info` then found every byte of what was published and `nix build
  # github:jxsuite/jx/release --max-jobs 0` still built from source, because the cache was complete
  # at an address nobody asks for (#250, first release after the submodule landed).
  #
  # Filtering it states the invariant instead: `$out` is a function of the tree's CONTENT, not of how
  # the tree arrived. The two trees are otherwise byte-identical — the NAR hash of the tarball source
  # minus `vendor` equals the NAR hash of the checkout source exactly.
