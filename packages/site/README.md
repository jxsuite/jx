# `@jxsuite/site`

**What a Jx project's page at a route consists of:** routing, layout, `<head>`, context and site style, as pure functions with their IO injected.

Every one of these rules has to be answered identically by four things that cannot share code any other way: the compiler's static build, the Studio canvas, a Bun dev/desktop server, and a Cloudflare Worker serving a live preview. None of them can import `@jxsuite/compiler`, whose dependency graph carries `sharp` and `esbuild`, so neither a browser bundle nor a Worker can load it. And a route is exactly the kind of rule where a silent disagreement is a page that 404s in one surface and renders in another.

So the rules live here, and this package has **no platform imports at all**: no `node:`, no DOM, no filesystem. Where a rule genuinely needs to read something, the reader is a parameter (`LayoutLoader`, `DocumentParser`) and is simply absent where there are no directories.

| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `./routes`      | What URL a page file has (`pages/blog/[slug].md` becomes `/blog/:slug`), and which route a request matches. Pure string math. |
| `./layout`      | What a page wrapped in its layout looks like: `$layout` resolution and `<slot>` distribution.                                 |
| `./context`     | What `$site.*` and `$page.*` hold before anything renders.                                                                    |
| `./head-merger` | How a site's, a layout's and a page's `$head` become one `<head>`, and how that `<head>` serializes.                          |
| `./site-style`  | How `project.json`'s `style` becomes a stylesheet, including the dual-emitted colour-scheme selectors.                        |
| `./compose`     | All of the above, applied: a route and a working tree become one merged document plus its `<head>`.                           |
| `./shell`       | That document as HTML: the page that hands itself to `@jxsuite/runtime` in the reader's browser.                              |
| `./paths`       | What an origin serving a project as a site may hand out, as an allowlist that defaults closed.                                |
| `./serve`       | The decision order a published site answers with: file, then route, then the host's own lane, then the project's own 404.     |

**Per-file exports, never a barrel.** Studio imports `./routes` into a browser bundle; a barrel would drag every other module in behind it.

## Composing without a compiler

`compose` and `shell` are what let a page render at its real URL with no build on the path. The server settles what it can (routing, layout, `<head>`, `$site`/`$page`) and the runtime assembles the DOM. Two things the build does are deliberately skipped, and both say so in the source: `$paths` is not expanded, because a route matches on demand and takes its parameters from the URL; and `imports` are not rebased, because the source tree is the served tree.

All IO is injected (`SiteIO`, `AssetIO`, `LayoutLoader`, `DocumentParser`), so the same code path answers off a disk, out of a Durable Object's SQLite table, or over `fetch`. A host that has the project's format registry passes a `DocumentParser` and `.md` pages render; one that does not omits it and gets a named error rather than a blank page.

## Where the rules are specified

`specs/site-architecture.md`: routing §4, layouts §5, `$head` §8, context §10, i18n §13. The spec is the source of truth; this package is its one implementation.

- `@jxsuite/schema` holds the document types, `parse` and `locale`. This package depends on it, and the edge is one-way and must stay that way.
- `@jxsuite/runtime` renders the document this package assembles.
- `@jxsuite/compiler` is the static build, which is one consumer rather than the owner.
