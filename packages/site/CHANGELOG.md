# Changelog

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/compare/site-v1.1.0...site-v2.0.0) (2026-09-06)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **runtime,compiler,site,studio:** `@jxsuite/runtime` no longer writes authored declarations to `el.style`, so code reading them back off an element after `applyStyle` sees nothing. The `elementStyleTags` export is replaced by `releaseElementStyles` and `resetDocumentStyles`, which refcount a shared rule set rather than handing out an element to remove by hand; `documentStyleText` reads back what was written.

### Features

* **runtime,compiler,site,studio:** authored styles become adopted CSS rules ([1542477](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/15424770e40f979eaaad78682004cf8d87f8180f))

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **schema,site:** `@jxsuite/schema` no longer exports `./routes`, `./layout`, `./context` or `./head-merger`. Import them from `@jxsuite/site`; the modules and their behaviour are unchanged.

### Features

* Open in Browser previews the working tree through the runtime ([b02e0e5](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/b02e0e543016879c963810f770b568995023e6ed))

### Bug Fixes

* **desktop,import:** the two gates the live preview left red, and the coverage it owed ([72657b7](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/72657b7c636d63aecb831378e5f16e134b062adb))
* **site:** the composer discovers the components a page uses, not only the ones it declares ([ef539ac](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/ef539ac2c91fdd1a6ea6d8e5b461090853eb4b03))


### Code Refactoring
