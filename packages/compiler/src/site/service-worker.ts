/**
 * An optional service worker, and the tombstone that makes turning it off mean something.
 *
 * A service worker is unlike every other output here: it is **sticky**. It survives redeploys, it
 * keeps running against a site that has moved on, and the visitors it breaks are precisely the ones
 * who came before — the people who already trusted the site enough to load it twice. Nothing else
 * the build emits can do that, which is why this one is off by default and why the interesting half
 * of the module is how you get rid of it.
 *
 * Three rules, and each exists because its absence produces a specific failure:
 *
 * 1. **Off by default.** A worker nobody asked for is a caching layer nobody debugged.
 * 2. **HTML is always network-first.** A cache-first worker serves a stale page indefinitely, and the
 *    author's next deploy cannot reach the visitor to fix it.
 * 3. **`serviceWorker: false` emits a tombstone** at the same URL: a worker that unregisters itself
 *    and deletes every cache it made. Without it, "off" only means "new visitors get nothing" —
 *    everyone who already registered keeps the old worker forever, and there is no way to reach
 *    them.
