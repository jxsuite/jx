/**
 * `<lastmod>` for a route that was generated rather than authored, end to end through a real build.
 *
 * The defect this pins is invisible in a unit test of any single layer. A collection route's
 * `sourcePath` is the `[slug]` template that rendered it, so the sitemap dated every post in an
 * archive by the template — and a template is edited far more often than the posts under it, which
 * means the whole archive announced itself as changed every time. `<lastmod>` exists to say the
 * opposite of that.
 *
 * Three layers have to agree for it to work, and each lives in a different package: the parser's
 * `Content.resolvePaths` carries the entry's `_meta`, the compiler's `$paths` expansion lifts it
 * off the parameters onto the route, and the sitemap prefers it over the template's own mtime. Only
 * a build exercises all three.
