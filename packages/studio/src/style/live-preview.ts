/**
 * Pushing a project-style edit to every live canvas — one definition site.
 *
 * §7.1's promise is that tuning a token shows the page changing, and until now that was true of
 * exactly one kind of canvas. `postSiteStyleToLiveHosts` skips stylebook hosts by construction
 * ({@link file://../canvas/iframe-host.ts}: `host.ready && !host.stylebook`), because a specimen
 * canvas does not render the site sheet — it renders a GENERATED document whose root carries the
 * transposed effective style, and its live channel is `styleUpdate`, not `siteStyleUpdate`. So a
 * token edited in the token editor reached every page canvas immediately and left the Project
 * Styles canvas — the one §7.1 puts _beside_ the editor — showing the old palette until something
 * forced a full re-render.
 *
 * Two hosts, two messages, one event. Every surface that writes `projectConfig.style` calls this
 * instead of picking one of the two posts, which is the only arrangement in which the pair cannot
 * drift apart again.

 * site style alone would silently drop them until the next full render. That is the one thing here
 * that reads the focused document, and it reads it to refresh a document-level canvas, not to
