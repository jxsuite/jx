/**
 * Token references — reading `var(--token)` as a binding, and rendering it as a chip.
 *
 * A style value that is exactly `var(--something)` is not a value, it is a reference to one. Raw
 * text says so only to a reader who already knows CSS: `var(--color-brand)` is eleven characters of
 * syntax around a name, and the thing the author actually wants to know — _which_ token, and what
 * it currently resolves to — is the part that is not shown. So a bound value renders as a **chip**
 * (plan §9.4), in the same vocabulary as the provenance chips shipped in P5: the token's friendly
 * name, and for a colour, its resolved swatch.
 *
 * The resolver follows a chain of references, because an alias token (`--color-accent:
 * var(--color-brand)`) is the normal way a palette is built and a chip that stopped at the first
 * hop would report `var(--color-brand)` as a colour.
