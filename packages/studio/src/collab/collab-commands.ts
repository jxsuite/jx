/**
 * The `Collaborate:` command family — the entry point and the exit co-editing has never had
 * (collab.md §4).
 *
 * Collaboration in Studio has been a thing that HAPPENS to a document: a session attaches because
 * the platform said the file was shared, presence chips appear in the toolbar, and there is no verb
 * anywhere in the app for starting it, inviting anybody, following someone, or stopping. The
 * palette had no `Collaborate:` rows at all, and `CATEGORIES` has carried the name since the
 * command registry landed with nothing filed under it.
 *
 * Five records, each registered here — in the module that owns the machinery, as §13.1 requires —
 * and composed by `commands/app-commands.ts`. Every one is idempotent or refuses with a `requires`
 * sentence, and none of them is a `toggle*` without a `set*` beside it: `collab.setEnabled` is the
 * setter, `collab.stop` is the same setter's `false` and exists because "stop sharing" is what a
 * person actually looks for in a palette.
