/**
 * CollabSession — the bridge between a tab's transactional document and a shared Y.Doc obtained
 * from `platform.collab(docPath)`.
 *
 * Outbound: the transact observer publishes every local transaction's forward JxDocOps into the Y
 * structure tree (un-instrumented and bypass writes reconcile by diff — the Y.Doc doubles as the
 * before-image). Inbound: remote Y transactions convert back into JxDocOps and replay through
 * `applyExternalDocOps`, riding the surgical canvas patcher; unconvertible shapes hard-reconcile
 * the tab from the Y tree. Undo becomes a local-origin-scoped Y.UndoManager registered as the tab's
 * history delegate.
 *
 * Saving is EXPLICIT even while attached: syncing edits to peers (the Y.Doc) is automatic, but
 * folding the shared source to disk is not. Local edits mark `tab.doc.dirty` immediately for
 * instant Save-button feedback; the room-level, server-authoritative unsaved state then arrives via
 * `handle.onDirty` (any peer's edit dirties the room for everyone; a save clears it for everyone).
 * Cmd+S / Save runs a serialize→mirror→flush, and the provider broadcasts the room clean once the
 * write lands.
 *
 * All yjs code sits behind a dynamic import: the unsplit bundle inlines the bytes, but module
 * evaluation defers until a collab session actually attaches.

     The exemption assumed a carrier that does not exist: a structural edit made by the lock holder

     `"source"`, and nothing notices, because the source observer fires on TEXT changes only. So the

     under `MIRROR_ORIGIN`. It then arrives at every peer through `applyExternalDocOps` (origin
     `"remote"`, which passes this gate by design), so the layer they deleted in the Outline
     reappeared seconds later with no explanation — and they were the one client this toast was
     never shown to.
     Mirroring the other way while source is canonical is not the alternative: it is exactly the
