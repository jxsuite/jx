/**
 * The **Entry editor** — a content entry's fields, as a form, in a pane (§7.4, plan §9.2).
 *
 * Until now a markdown entry could be edited two ways and neither was its schema: the canvas edited
 * its BODY, and the Document Header card drew a field list from `panels/frontmatter-fields.ts`'s
 * own type→widget ladder, which is a second implementation of `ui/schema-form.ts` with no reference
 * branch, no validation and no value-source ladder. A JSON entry (`authors/ada.json`) had no field
 * editor at all — it opened as a component tree, so `bio` was a node's property and `links` was a
 * child array.
 *
 * This is one editor over `renderForm`, so every improvement to the engine reaches content entries,
 * settings and the inspector at once — and the `reference` control in particular arrives here for
 * free, which is what makes `author: { "$ref": "#/content/authors" }` a picker instead of a text
 * field you have to type an id into.
 *
 * **It is an editor of the same tab, not a second document.** Like `settings/settings-document.ts`,
 * it unshifts its mode onto the tab the file already has, so ⌘S, the dirty flag, the transaction
 * log and undo are the ordinary document verbs. Every field commits through
 * {@link mutateEntryField}, so an edit made here is undone by ⌘Z and replayed by a collaborator
 * exactly as one made in the Document Header card.
 *
 * **One editor, two storage shapes.** A markdown entry keeps its fields in frontmatter; a JSON
 * entry IS its fields. `content/entry-fields.ts` owns that single question, and this file never
 * touches `content.frontmatter` directly — reading it unconditionally is what made a JSON entry's
 * form blank, its valid required fields look absent, and every edit vanish at save time.
 *
 * **The mode is registered in all three tables.** `commands/context.ts` holds the one map from mode
 * to editor kind; a mode missing from it does not fail, it silently answers `"canvas"`, and that is
 * how ⌘V once inserted an element node into `project.json`. `entry` → `entry` → "Entry" is added to
 * `EDITOR_KIND_BY_MODE`, `EditorKind` and `EDITOR_KIND_LABELS` in the same change as this file.
