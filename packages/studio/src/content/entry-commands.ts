 * Each is a record in its owning module, so the palette row, the assistant's tool, the automation
 * step and (for the two that declare one) the context-menu item are renderings of the same
 * declaration. Two of them are **setters and not toggles** — `content.setDraft {draft}` and
 * `content.setIncludeDrafts {include}` name the state they reach, because "toggle the draft flag"
 * run twice by a script leaves the entry exactly where it started and run once against an unknown
 * default publishes something private.
