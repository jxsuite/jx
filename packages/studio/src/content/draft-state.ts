/**
 * The draft axis (site-architecture.md §7.6) — what a draft IS, and whether drafts are listed. One
 * place, every list.
 *
 * It is deliberately its own module rather than a field on a pane's state and rather than a section
 * of `entry-model.ts`. Two reasons, and the second is why the definitions live here beside the
 * flag:
 *
 * 1. **The perspective is a fact about the AUTHOR, not the surface.** A draft filter that belonged to
 *    the Library would answer for the Library only, and the same author would then be shown their
 *    draft in the collection grid, in the pages grid and in Quick Open a second later.
 * 2. **Every list that must obey it has to be able to import it.** `entry-model.ts` asks
 *    `grid/sources/content-source.ts` where a collection's entries live, so the grid source cannot
 *    ask `entry-model.ts` back what a draft is — `import/no-cycle` is an error in this repo, and
 *    the cycle would be real. This module has ONE runtime dependency (`reactivity`), so the flag
 *    and the predicate are importable from a data module, a panel and a command alike. That is the
 *    property that lets the surfaces actually share them, instead of each carrying its own `draft
 *    === true`.
