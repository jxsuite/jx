/**
 * **Where a content entry's fields live**, and the one mutation that writes them.
 *
 * A collection has two storage shapes and exactly one editor, so the question "what record am I
 * editing?" has to be answered once, here, rather than assumed at every read site.
 *
 * - A **markdown** entry (or any file a format class parsed) is a frontmatter block plus a body. Its
 *   fields are `tab.doc.content.frontmatter`; `tab.doc.document` is the prose.
 * - A **JSON** entry (site-architecture.md §6.2's native collection shape) has no frontmatter block
 *   to split off. `files/files.ts` parses it straight into `tab.doc.document`, and
 *   `files/file-ops.ts` writes that object back as the whole file. Its fields ARE the document.
 *
 * The Entry editor read `content.frontmatter` unconditionally. For a JSON entry that record is `{}`
 * — so the form drew blank rows for an entry full of data, `absentRequiredErrors` accused a valid
 * entry of missing its required fields, and every keystroke was committed to a record that
 * `serializeDocument` never writes: the edit marked the tab dirty, survived undo, and was discarded
 * by ⌘S under a "Saved" toast. Three symptoms, one wrong assumption about storage.
 *
 * **The discriminator is the serializer's own ladder, not a guess about the extension.**
 * `serializeDocument` writes `JSON.stringify(tab.doc.document)` for exactly one kind of tab: no
 * format class claimed it (`sourceFormat === null`) and it is not a content-mode document. Those
 * are the two reads {@link fieldsAreDocument} makes, so "which record does the form edit" and
 * "which record does save write" cannot drift apart — and if a project ever registers a format
 * class for `.json`, both answers move together to frontmatter.
 *
 * Both shapes mutate with the same semantics — `undefined`, `null` and `""` remove the key, every
 * other value is written — so an author cannot tell from the form's behaviour which one they are
 * editing. That is the point.
