/**
 * Publish-commands.ts — the `Publish:` family (plan §9.5), defined beside the deploy it drives.
 *
 * Two unrelated operations were called "Publish" and neither was a command. `publishToGithub`
 * created a git repository; `openPublishPanel` connected Cloudflare Pages — and it had **zero call
 * sites in `src/`**, reachable only through the screenshot runner's seed, so the one flow that
 * ships a site was, in the shipped app, unreachable. The toolbar's Publish button had already gone
 * with the toolbar, and nothing replaced it.
 *
 * Three records, always reachable, each disabled with the one sentence that says why:
 *
 * | id                      | what it does                                              |
 * | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
 * | `publish.setUp`         | opens the provider connection flow                        |
 * | `publish.deploy`        | pushes the branch and asks Cloudflare what it did with it |
 * | `publish.openDashboard` | opens the connected Pages project on Cloudflare           |
 *
 * **`runDeploy` is an Activity, not a toast.** A deploy pushes a branch and then waits on a build
 * that is happening somewhere else; that is the definition of the long operation §7.3 gave the
 * Activity tab, and `fail()` raises the Problem so the failure outlives the run and carries a
 * Retry. The caller therefore never also notifies (§16).
 *
 * **No credential is read here.** Whether a provider is reachable is a capability question, and
 * whether one is connected is a `project.json` question; the token that proves it is read only by
 * `platforms/devserver.ts` on its way to the same-origin proxy (`studio.md` §15 rule 1).
 *
 * **The panel is imported lazily** so this module carries no DOM at import time: `commands/
 * app-commands.ts` is loaded by three CI checks in a bare Bun process, and a module that opens a
 * modal at import would break all three.

 * says which of the two it is waiting for, because a progress line that implies the former and
 * delivers the latter is the dishonesty §7.3 exists to end.
