/**
 * Drill into a component (or a layout) — as a REAL TAB, not a document swapped in under the current
 * tab's id, and BESIDE the page rather than over it.
 *
 * The old implementation rewrote `tab.documentPath` and left `tab.id` alone, and everything
 * downstream believed the id: `openFileInTab`'s dedupe stopped matching, so re-opening the page
 * from the tree called `openTab` with an id that was already in the map — overwriting the entry
 * without disposing the old tab's effect scope and pushing a SECOND copy of the id into `tabOrder`,
 * which is a duplicate lit `repeat` key and a lost document stack.
 *
 * What the drill-in keeps is the RELATIONSHIP: the new tab records the document it was opened from
 * and the strip prints it. The parent stays open, right where it was.
 *
 * Four deliberate properties, three of them new and each with a failure behind it:
 *
 * 1. **To the side.** §8.2 has promised this since P3 and it never shipped — the chain ran
 *    `openFileInTab` → `openTab` → `activePane()`, so "open the layout that wraps this page" opened
 *    it ON TOP of the page it was teaching about.
 * 2. **Focus stays in the page.** An assistant pane that takes the keyboard means the author's next
 *    keystroke edits the definition instead of the document they are looking at — and a following
 *    pane would immediately have nothing to follow.
 * 3. **A PREVIEW tab**, because drilling in is browsing: the second drill-in takes the same slot
 *    instead of littering the side strip, and an edit promotes it (`promoteDirtyPreviewTabs`).
 * 4. **An ordinary tab, not a derivation.** "Edit definition" is a commitment to edit one component; a
 *    following pane would yank to a different one on the author's next canvas click. The following
 *    form is `pane.derive { preset: "component" }`, opted into by name.
 *
 * `openedFrom` is unchanged — §14.2's relationship, which nothing pops and nothing restores from.

/* Two duties, one listener, because both answer the same question: intent has left the canvas.
   Pointerdowns over the canvas land inside the cross-origin iframe and never reach this listener,
   so a hit here IS parent chrome — which is why the listener can be this blunt and why it cannot
   double-fire with the iframe's own click-away commit.

   1. Commit-on-parent-click: it ends the live inline-edit session, which the iframe cannot observe
      itself (layers panel, tab strip, right panel…).
   2. The block action bar goes with it. The bar is `position: fixed` and clamped into the window,
      so it can sit over the Document Header card, the pane context bar and the docks; an author
      working in the Inspector's Logic tab reported it "blocking a part of the interface that the
      user needs to utilize". It is SUPPRESSED, not dismissed — a plain dismiss flashes back on the
      next snapshot or overlay repaint — and it comes back the moment the canvas takes a pointer or
      the selection moves. Nothing here touches the selection: the Inspector edits the selected
      node, so a click into it must keep the thing it is about to edit.

   Both spare the edit-session chrome (`isEditChromeTarget`: the bar, its `⋮` menu, the link
   popover, the slash menu) — those surfaces act ON the session and the bar rather than away from
   them. Only the suppression spares the canvas STAGE, whose margins, artboard headers and insertion
   "+" are parent-realm elements around the frame: they are the canvas, not somewhere else in the
   shell, and hiding the bar to pan or to nudge the zoom would be the app losing the author's place

   `CanvasSurface`. So the pan and the wrap were per-stage and the SCALE was not: the unfocused pane
   drew at the focused tab's scale, the side pane's `+` zoomed the primary's document, and the side
   pane entering Design snapped the primary to whatever it had fitted itself to. `getCanvasMode`
   was the same shape one layer down. The module reaches all three through the surface it is given
   (`tabOfPane(surface.paneId)`), so there is nothing left to inject.

   No `initCanvasLiveRender` either, and it went for the same reason one layer further down again.
   `getCanvasMode` was the ONLY thing that context carried, and `resolveCanvasDocument` used it
   while ALSO reading `activeTab.value` for the document path, the layout toggle and the preview
   params — so the pane the render had already been resolved for was discarded and the focused
   pane's answers substituted for all six. It takes the tab now, and the injection point had
   nothing else in it. */

/**
 * One pane's render subscriptions.

 * Effect-driven canvas rendering, split into three triggers so document changes can be
 * distinguished from mode/UI changes:
 *
 * - Doc-effect: tracks only the document root reference. Document mutations that were consumed
 *   surgically by the canvas patcher skip the full render here.
 * - Ui-effect: tracks canvas mode and UI flags; always schedules a full render.
 * - The colour-scheme post, which is a document-level attribute flip inside the iframe and
 *   deliberately never part of the ui-effect: flipping the scheme must not re-render.
 *
 * Scheduling is deduped inside `scheduleCanvasRender` (double-RAF).
 *
 * **Keyed on the PANE, not on `activeTab`, and this is what makes `⌘\` and Unsplit work at all.**
 * Both effects used to read the focused pane's tab and schedule "the" canvas. A split moves a tab
 * between panes without changing which tab is active, so neither effect re-ran: the pane the tab
 * LEFT went on displaying it, and Unsplit — where the survivor's `activeTabId` changes but
 * `activeTab` does not — left the primary showing document A while the strip, the jump bar and the
 * Inspector all said B. `tabOfPane` tracks the pane's own `activeTabId`, so the pane that changed
 * is the pane that repaints.
