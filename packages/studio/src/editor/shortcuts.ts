/**
 * Shortcuts.ts — the pointer surface of the canvas, and the keyboard's one dispatcher.
 *
 * Two unrelated jobs share this file because they share the canvas element:
 *
 * 1. **Wheel, middle-mouse pan and resize.** Unchanged: these are gestures over `canvasWrap`, not
 *    commands, and there is no chord to register them under.
 * 2. **Keyboard.** Formerly a 403-line `keydown` switch — twelve modifier chords and seven bare keys
 *    hand-matched against the canvas mode, with three blanket guards in front. It is now a
 *    dispatcher of about thirty lines: build the scope stack from the command context, hand the
 *    event to the registry, and `preventDefault()` iff a command claimed it.
 *
 * The three guards did not move, they were replaced by mechanisms that generalise:
 *
 * | Old guard                                              | Now                                     |
 * | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
 * | `if (isModalOpen()) return`                            | `modal.open` → the `palette`-only stack |
 * | `canvasMode === "grid" && !["o","p","s","w","z","Z"]…` | the `grid` stack (see `keyScopeStack`)  |
 * | the caret / text-input early return                    | the `caret` stack, which drops `canvas` |
 *
 * A chord whose command's `when` is false is deliberately NOT swallowed: `handleKeyEvent` returns
 * `undefined`, nothing calls `preventDefault`, and the key falls through to the browser. That is
 * how ↑/↓ still scroll a surface with no selection, and how ⌘Z reaches a text field's native undo
 * when no document is open.
 *
 * This file is also the definition site for the commands it implements — the clipboard trio, the
 * three zoom verbs and the four selection-navigation verbs — plus the implementations behind the
 * document- and selection-level records declared in `commands/defaults.ts`. Registration lives next
 * to the code that runs, so a chord and its behaviour cannot drift apart again.

 * {@link StudioCommandHooks}.
 *
 * **This is the KEYBOARD's registry, not yet the app's.** Three other contribution points landed in
 * the same wave and each built its own registry over its own context — `editor/context-menu.ts`
 * (the element menu, over the node the open MENU addresses), `panels/block-action-bar.ts` and
 * `workspace/workspace.ts`. Composing all four into one app-wide registry is the follow-up PR, and
 * these four records are what it has to reconcile:
 *

 * | `edit.copy` / `edit.cut`  | same ids in `context-menu.ts`               | THEIRS — the implementation lives there; it needs a selection-derived `target()`                                                                 |
 * | `edit.paste`              | `edit.pasteAfter` / `edit.pasteInside`      | theirs, once one of them covers "paste into the root with nothing selected", which ⌘V does today                                                 |
 * | `selection.insertSibling` | `selection.insertAfter` (unbound, no chord) | theirs, once it SELECTS the inserted node — the canvas re-enters inline edit off that selection, and Enter-to-add-a-paragraph is dead without it |
 *
 * PAID, for the four that were literal duplicates. `edit.copy` and `edit.cut` are defined here and
 * nowhere else (the menu inherits them by `menus`), and `selection.editComponent` /
 * `selection.convertToComponent` are defined once in `panels/block-action-bar.ts`. The remaining
