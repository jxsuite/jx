/* **Every dispatcher below takes the tab it writes, and none of them can find one on its own.**
   All three used to open with `const tab = activeTab.value`, which made "the document this
   control is about" and "the document the keyboard happens to be in" the same expression — the
   defect that produced the Document Header card writing through focus, the zoom axis writing
   through focus, the debounced Monaco commit writing through focus, and the whole pane context
   bar writing through focus. Four instances, four audits, no gate: while the shell had one stage
   the two readings could not disagree, so nothing could observe the difference.

   `store.ts` is where they could not disagree, so `store.ts` is where the shape is fixed. There is
   no `activeTab` import in this file and no zero-argument variant of any of these: a caller that
   means the focused pane spells `activeTab.value` at its own call site, where a reviewer and
   `scripts/check-pane-singletons.ts` can both see it, and a caller drawn FOR a pane passes the tab
   it was drawn for. */
