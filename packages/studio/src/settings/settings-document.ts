/**
 * Project Settings — a **document**, not a modal.
 *
 * Its predecessor (`settings-modal.ts`) was an `inset: 40px` overlay with a scrim, which meant that
 * while you tuned a design token that pushes live to the canvas, the canvas was behind the thing
 * you were tuning it in, ⌘S/⌘Z/⌘P were suspended, and "Open Data Grid" opened a tab you could not
 * see. Plan §9.3 replaces it with a document in the pane whose sections are INNER NAV: Overview ·
 * Contexts · Site head · CSS Variables · Definitions · Content types · Packages · Extensions ·
 * Deploy · Raw JSON.
 *
 * **The document is the `project.json` tab.** P6.1 made `project.json` a real Tab under the
 * transaction log with one write chokepoint (`tabs/project-config.ts`); this module opens that same
 * tab — same id, same document object — in the `settings` canvas mode. So the settings form, the
 * Project Styles catalogue and the raw JSON are three editors over ONE document, and undo, the
 * dirty flag and ⌘S are the ordinary document verbs rather than three bespoke ones. That is the
 * whole of P6.1's disclosed residual ("⌘Z reaches config history only when the `project.json` tab
 * is focused"): the settings surface now IS that tab.
 *
 * **`settings.open` did not change what it means.** §13.7 makes this phase's deliverable a
 * near-zero manifest diff: the command still means "reach project settings, optionally at a named
 * section", its args schema still declares `section`, and every shot step that names it is
 * untouched. What changed is the `run` — a Tab instead of a modal — and the frame the seven region
 * crops are taken in.

   every one of them resolved to nothing the moment the nav was ready to draw one. The field is
   still documented as reserved (`section-registry.ts`), so nothing here draws today; the names are

 * The third was refused outright by plan §13.3 because its press-shim mirrored the section
 * registry's LABELS in a hand-kept map; the fourth was raw input standing in for a verb that did
 * not exist ("`settings.selectEntry` has no command record", `until: "P6.2"`). Sections have KEYS
 * and map-layout sections have ENTRY keys; this names both, so the manifest's input-step budget
 * falls by five and its unstable budget by five without one `settings.open` step changing.
 *
 * The validation is deliberately asynchronous. Extension-contributed sections (`connections`,
 * `data`, `content`) register a tick after the document opens, so refusing synchronously would
 * reject three legitimate section ids; the command opens, awaits the sync, and only then decides
 * whether the caller named something real. A wrong key therefore fails the step instead of
