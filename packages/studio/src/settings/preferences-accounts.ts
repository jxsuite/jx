/**
 * Preferences-accounts.ts — every credential Studio holds, in one list that can also forget them.
 *
 * Studio stores three kinds of secret in three unrelated places and, until this file, could neither
 * enumerate nor clear any of them:
 *
 * - The GitHub device-flow token (`github/github-auth.ts`) — `clearGithubToken()` had **zero
 *   callers**, so signing out was impossible from inside the app;
 * - The AI provider key, endpoint and model (`services/ai-settings.ts`) — clearable only by saving a
 *   blank key into a dialog that did not say that is what a blank key means;
 * - The Cloudflare publish token and account id (`services/cf-settings.ts`) — not clearable at all.
 *
 * Plan §9.3 puts them under Preferences › Accounts, "listed, revocable". This module is that list.
 * It is deliberately UI-free — a record per account with a `revoke` — so the disconnect path is
 * testable without a dialog, and so the same records can back a future Problems entry or an
 * `accounts.revoke` command without being re-derived from a template.
 *
 * **No secret is ever returned.** A record says whether something is stored and what it is for;
 * printing a token into a list is how a screenshot leaks one.
 *
 * **Cloudflare has two spellings, and this file used to know only one.** On a platform that brokers
 * the connection (Jx Cloud), there is no local token to enumerate — `getCfToken()` is empty by
 * design — so the row said "Not connected" to every hosted user, named no account, and offered a
 * Disconnect that cleared nothing server-side. The hosted state comes from the PAL instead, cached
 * here because a template must not start a fetch on every repaint.
