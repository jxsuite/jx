/**
 * The Preferences sections — the values `app.preferences { section }` accepts.
 *
 * A LEAF: it imports nothing, and that is the whole reason it is a file. `preferences-dialog.ts`
 * reaches `ui/layers`, `ui/ai-credentials-form`, `ui/ai-managed-connect`, `preferences-accounts` (→
 * github-auth, cf-settings, ai-settings, ai-models) and `preferences-keymap` (→
 * services/settings/kernel) — a graph so wide that `tests/preferences-dialog.test.ts` mocks
 * `ai-models` merely to import the module at all. The rail's gear menu needs four labels from it
 * and nothing else, so it takes the labels rather than the graph.
 *
 * Same split, and the same stated reason, as `settings/section-registry.ts`: what is contributed to
 * is not the surface that renders it, and keeping the two apart is what lets either be replaced.
 *
 * `preferences-dialog.ts` re-exports every symbol here, so no existing import site moved.
