/**
 * The three verbs over `project.json` `extensions[]`, and the operations behind them.
 *
 * **They are command records because the array has two writers.** The person flips a switch and the
 * assistant calls a tool, and `specs/studio-ui-guidelines.md` §12.4 is about exactly that: "the
 * agent counts as a surface", and a family over one piece of state declares ONE availability rule.
 * The tools in `services/ai-extension-tools.ts` execute by running these records rather than
 * reimplementing the writes, so the two gates cannot drift into the shape that table catalogues,
 * where the loose member is always the one that writes.
 *
 * **`enablement` is `ctx.project.open` and nothing else, on all three.** A precondition that
 * depends on an ARGUMENT cannot live there — `enablement` cannot see one — so "is this a real
 * extension?", "can this backend run it?" and "is it still enabled?" are refused with a
 * `RangeError` naming the value, the shape §12.4 prescribes and `pane.derive` already uses. The
 * first two are answered by the derived enum that `registry.run` coerces `package` against — a
 * value outside it reads `is not declared — declared: …` — and the sentences inside `run` remain
 * for the callers that reach it directly (the Extensions section's switch) and for a row that
 * changed between the schema being read and the verb running.
 *
 * **The in-flight latch lives here, not in the section**, because the assistant can run these too:
 * a latch the renderer owned would let a tool call and a click install concurrently.
