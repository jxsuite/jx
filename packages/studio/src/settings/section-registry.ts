/**
 * The Project Settings section registry, and which of its sections the document is showing.
 *
 * `registerSettingsSection` is a **preserved public contract** (specs/extensions.md §9.1): an
 * extension's `project` class declares a `$studio.settings` block and `settings/extension-sections`
 * turns it into one of these records. P6 moved Project Settings out of a modal and into a document
 * in the pane; the registry did not move with it, because a section is a contribution to
 * CONFIGURATION, not to a dialog. Splitting it out is what lets the host be replaced without the
 * contribution point being touched.
 *
 * **This module holds no renderer and imports nothing.** That is load-bearing rather than tidy:
 * `panels/settings-pane.ts` is reached from `canvas/canvas-render.ts`, so anything this module
 * imports becomes part of the canvas's import graph. The section RENDERERS are registered by
 * `settings/settings-document.ts`, which the app loads when it registers its commands.
 *
 * **What is requested and what is displayed are two variables, and unregistering touches neither.**
 * The modal had one, and its `unregisterSettingsSection` reset it to `"general"` — which is half of
 * the deep-link race P6 exists to close. The contribution sync unregisters stale keys before it
 * registers fresh ones, so a section merely being REFRESHED took the caller's requested section
 * down with it, silently, after the awaited readiness promise had already resolved. Here a request
 * outlives its section going away and is satisfied the moment the key comes back.
