/**
 * Preferences-dialog.ts — ⌘, the application-preferences surface Studio did not have.
 *
 * Plan §9.3 draws the line this file finally makes real. **Project Settings** configures a project
 * and belongs to the project (breakpoints, definitions, deploy); **Preferences** configures the
 * application and follows you between them. Studio shipped only the first, behind a gear in the
 * rail — the slot every other editor spends on the second — and so had nowhere at all to put the
 * chrome theme, the assistant's provider key, the keyboard, or the three credentials it holds.
 *
 * Four sections, and each one closes a hole that was named in the plan:
 *
 * - **Appearance** — the chrome theme. `shell.theme` and `view.setTheme` already existed; nothing
 *   rendered them, so the only way to change the theme was to run a command by hand.
 * - **Assistant** — the provider key. It used to live in `Assistant: Settings…`, a dialog reachable
 *   only from inside the assistant panel, which meant a key had to be configured from the surface
 *   that was broken for want of one. That dialog is deleted; this is where it went.
 * - **Accounts** — GitHub, the AI provider and Cloudflare, listed with a Disconnect each. Before
 *   this, `clearGithubToken()` had zero callers: signing out of GitHub was not expressible.
 * - **Keyboard** — GENERATED from `commands/reference.ts`'s `shortcutReference()`, the same
 *   projection `docs/studio/interface/shortcuts.md` is built from. The registry is the one place a
 *   chord is declared, so the sheet cannot drift from the app or from the docs. Per §13.5 there is
 *   deliberately no screenshot of it — photographing generated content is a bug. It is searchable
 *   two ways, because there are two questions ("what is the shortcut for X" and "what did I just
 *   press"), and rebindable — as a LAYER over the registry (`settings/preferences-keymap.ts`), so
 *   the sheet stays a projection and the app's own record of a default is never edited.
 *
 * Modality: an `sp-dialog-wrapper` through {@link showDialog}, which is focus-managed and dismissed
 * by Escape — not `openModal`'s `inset:40px` blackout. Preferences does not suspend the app.
