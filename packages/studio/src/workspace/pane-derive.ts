/**
 * Derived panes (§18.4) — the pane beside this one, showing a projection of it.
 *
 * **Two families, one field.** `Pane.derived` carries either a LENS or a COMPANION, and the
 * distinction is not cosmetic — it is what keeps §14.1 intact:
 *
 * - A **lens** (`code`, `diff`, `breakpoint`) draws the SAME document the source pane owns, in a
 *   mode, at a breakpoint or against a diff of its own. It owns no tab at all, so no id maps to two
 *   documents and no document takes two ids. `canvas-surface.ts`'s `tabOfPane` takes one hop
 *   through `sourcePaneId`, and every pane-scoped renderer in the package starts working on it for
 *   free — which is also why the follow costs nothing: switching tabs in the source pane repaints
 *   the lens because it is the same reactive read.
 * - A **companion** (`layout`, `component`) shows a DIFFERENT document chosen by a rule from the
 *   source. That is an ordinary path-keyed tab this pane owns; the derivation only decides which of
 *   its tabs is on screen, which is what activation has always done.
 *
 * §14.1 is therefore SHARPENED rather than amended: **ownership is one-to-one, display is
 * many-to-one.** A tab id appears in at most one pane's `tabOrder`, and every verb that closes,
 * disposes, reorders, pins or MRU-tracks a tab resolves through `paneOfTab` — so it addresses the
 * owner and only the owner. `closeTab`, `detachTab`, `setTabPinned`, `moveTab`, `renameTab`,
 * `rememberClosedTab`, `ensureCollab`, `promoteMru` and `openFileInTab`'s dedupe need no change at
 * all: none of them can see a lens pane, whose `tabOrder` is empty.
 *
 * **What is NOT here, and why.** No derived Tab of any kind — no `derived:code:<path>` id sharing a
 * document, no off-map `Map<paneId, Tab>`. Both mint a second tab LIFETIME: the first costs four
 * exclusion predicates (MRU, reopen-closed, collab keying, close-all counting) that must each be
 * written and tested rather than assumed; the second costs a second disposal path, where one missed
 * `disposeTab` is an `effectScope` reacting to a document forever. Neither is needed once ownership
 * and display are separated.

 *
 * `pane.derive`'s `enablement` opened with `activePane()` and the menu asked the registry
 * `disabledReason("pane.derive")` for a pane it had been handed by name — so the same pane got two
 * answers depending on where the keyboard was, and every row in the SECONDARY pane's menu was
 * permanently disabled the moment the author clicked into the lens beside it.
 *
 * **The structural point, stated once here.** A command's `enablement(ctx)` receives no pane, and
 * it cannot: a command's subject IS the focused pane, which is what makes `⌘\` mean "split the
 * thing I am looking at". A per-pane MENU is a different question with a different subject, so it
 * must not be routed through a predicate that resolves one. The answer therefore lives in a pure
 * predicate the menu calls with its own pane, and the command record reuses it for the focused one
 * — one rule, two subjects, no second definition site.
 *
 * `scripts/check-pane-singletons.ts` rule 4 charges a pane-scoped function for reading the focus
 * one hop in, and it could not see this one: the hop was a METHOD CALL on a registry value,
 * dispatched by a string id to a closure built in another module. Following THAT needs a type
 * checker. What the rule can decide is that the question was asked, so `disabledReason` and
 * `isEnabled` are focus reads now — see that file's {@link FOCUS_NAMES}. The closure is still
 * invisible and is not pretended otherwise.
 *
