/**
 * Session.ts — what a project looked like when you left it, and how it looks that way again.
 *
 * Plan §4.4: "Session state persists **per project root** … open tabs and order per pane, active
 * tab, per-tab editor kind / view / zoom / rendering context." P3's "Newly possible" states the
 * consequence plainly: **the session survives a relaunch.** Neither shipped. The per-project record
 * held `layouts` and `activeLayout` and nothing else, its interface said "Session state (§4.4)
 * grows into this shape", and reopening a project landed on the home page with an empty strip — so
 * nine open documents, a split, and the breakpoint you were checking were lost every time.
 *
 * **Paths, not tab ids.** A tab id is minted per open and means nothing across a reload; the
 * document's path is the identity the workspace already dedupes on (`openFileInTab` scans
 * `tab.documentPath`). A stored path that no longer resolves is skipped on restore rather than
 * failing the whole session — files move, and losing the other eight tabs because one was renamed
 * would be worse than the problem this solves.
 *
 * **Only what the author chose.** Per tab it records the canvas mode, the preview flag, the zooms
 * and the rendering context — the settings a person deliberately put a document into. Selection,
 * hover, clipboard, undo history and the live canvas scope are all derived or transient, and
 * restoring a selection into a document that has since changed on disk would point at a node that
 * may not exist.
 *
 * **Untrusted input.** Everything read back is `localStorage`, which is hand-editable and survives
 * across versions. Every field is validated on the way in and a bad record restores nothing.
