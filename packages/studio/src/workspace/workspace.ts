 * - A **lens** re-draws the SAME document its source pane is showing, in a different mode, at a

 *   untouched — what changes is only the unstated operational corollary that a tab lived in one
 *   pane. Ownership stays one-to-one; DISPLAY becomes many-to-one.
 * - A **companion** shows a DIFFERENT document chosen by a rule from the source — the layout that
 *   wraps its page, the component definition under its selection, the same page written in another
 *   language. That is an ordinary path-keyed tab which this pane owns normally; the derivation only
 *   decides WHICH of its tabs is on screen, which is what `activateTab` has always done.

 * The split is also the answer to what Pin means: a companion can be pinned (it names a different

 * - `pane.compareWith` landed its tab in the lens's `tabOrder`, where `tabOfPane` hopped straight
 *   past it to the source pane: the compared document was in no strip and on no stage, and the
 *   follow — which tracks `derived` and the SOURCE pane's tab, neither of which a tab insertion
 *   touches — never ran to repair it.
 * - `navigateToComponent` read `tabOfPane(target.id)` back and got the SOURCE tab, so the §14.2

 * an explicit instruction about the pane a projection is currently borrowing, and a projection is a

 * them the gesture.
 *
 * **A COMPANION is released too, and leaving it alone was the defect.** "It owns real tabs, so the
 * new one simply joins them" is true of the TABS and false of everything else. A layout companion
 * that has just been handed the page the author split in is still following the source pane's
 * `$layout`, so the next click on layout chrome re-points it and throws the new document off

 * me, unless I am in it" — a complete answer while a second pane could only arrive by splitting and
 * both panes were the same kind of thing. A derived pane is not: it is subordinate to the pane it
 * projects, it is mintable in EITHER direction (derive from the secondary and the PRIMARY becomes
 * the projection), and two new surfaces offer this command as _that pane's own exit_ — the
 * derivation chip's ✕ in `panels/tab-strip.ts` and the `Close Side Pane` row of its own preset
 * menu. Both focus their pane before running, so with a derived PRIMARY the old expression read the
 * focus, saw `PRIMARY`, and closed the pane holding the author's work:
 *
 *     before: primary[pages/index.json]*derived  secondary[scratch.json]  focus=secondary
 *     after:  primary[pages/index.json, scratch.json]                     focus=primary
 *
 * Scanning for the derivation is the same shape `pane-derive.ts`'s `pinnablePane` uses, and for the
 * same reason: a grid holds at most one derived pane, so the answer reads no focus and is therefore
 * the same from the palette, from the chip and from either pane's menu.
 *
 * **One title, two acts, because for every pane that CAN leave the grid they are the same act.**
 * Closing a projection's pane ends the projection. {@link closePane} refuses to remove the PRIMARY
 * — it is `panes[0]`, the id `resolveRegion("pane")` canonicalises onto and nine screenshots crop —
 * so for a derived primary only the second half is available: the derivation is dropped and the
 * pane keeps whatever it owns. Passing `PRIMARY_PANE` to `closePane` would not have done that; it
 * redirects to "collapse the other pane instead", which is how pressing the projection's ✕ closed
 * the author's second pane and left them looking at the projection's document.
 *
 * A LENS owns no tab, so ending its derivation leaves a pane with no subject — §18.1 rule 3 — and
 * the repair for an empty primary is exactly that redirect. That case therefore still collapses,
 * which is right: unsplitting a Code lens should leave you with the document.
