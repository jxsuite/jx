/**
 * The Library — an editor kind, drawn into the pane, over a {@link LibrarySource}.
 *
 * It replaces the Manage view, which was a full-screen MODAL over the whole shell. Everything that
 * was wrong with that follows from the modal: it could not be a tab, so it could not be one of two
 * panes, so it could not be open beside the page you were browsing FOR; it had no editor kind, so
 * the status bar and the pane context bar had nothing to say about it; and its own filter bar was
 * the only way to reach any of its state, so nothing it did was in the palette, on a chord, or
 * available to the assistant. `manage` was already in `commands/context.ts`'s `EDITOR_KIND_BY_MODE`
 * — the map just had nothing behind it.
 *
 * The MARKUP is `surfaces/library-pane.json`, a Jx document over the kit; this module is the
 * projection and the decisions. Four things it is careful about:
 *
 * 1. **It never says "No files found" for two different reasons.** A scan that could not read a
 *    directory is INCOMPLETE, not empty; it raises a Problem carrying the directory and a Retry
 *    (`library.refresh`), and the surface says so. A filter that matched nothing says which filter.
 *    The four states are one word on the scope, so no two of them can be true at once.
 * 2. **The rendered item count is proportional to the viewport, not to the project.** See
 *    `../ui/virtual-window.ts` and `library-preview.ts`; the acceptance case is 300 pages in
 *    "All".
 * 3. **An upload has a named destination**, shown before the drop, asked for when the active category
 *    does not name one.
 * 4. **Creation is somebody else's flow.** A page, layout or component is `files.ts`'s creation, so a
 *    new page from the Library and a new file from the tree refuse a name that is already taken in
 *    exactly the same way; a collection entry is `content/entry-commands.ts`'s `createEntry`, so it
 *    arrives with the collection's extension and a body seeded from that collection's schema.

 * box, so nothing re-announces it — and an LRU eviction detaches the render that was inside it. So

/**
 * Create one entity and open it.
 *
 * Two paths, because a collection entry is not a blank document. A **collection** row goes through
 * `content/entry-commands.ts`'s `createEntry`, which supplies the collection's extension (so the
 * field asks for a display name and the file is actually matched by the collection it was created
 * in) and a body seeded from the collection's **schema defaults** — the entry is valid the moment
 * it exists, rather than a pile of absent required fields — and then opens it in the entry FORM,
 * which is the editor that collection's fields belong to. Both of those are the reason
 * `createEntry` is called rather than reimplemented; a second seeder here would drift from the one
 * the palette's `content.newEntry` uses within a release.
 *
 * A **document kind** gets the format PICKER, which is the same argument the verbatim name field
 * used to make: a page may be a `.md` as easily as a `.json`, so the extension is a real choice —
 * now offered rather than left to be typed from memory. A collection's extension is not a choice;
 * it is the collection's, and `createEntry` supplies it.
 *
 * **A layout is not a choice either, and that is not a policy.** Both readers of a layout parse it
 * as JSON and neither dispatches through the format registry — `site/layout-resolver.ts` throws and
 * `site-context.ts` returns null — so a `.md` layout is a file the build cannot load. There is no
 * `"layout"` document kind for a format to declare, so this is stated here rather than derived.
 *
 * A **component** keeps the picker: a format whose `$studio.documentMode.componentWhen` promotes a
 * frontmatter `tagName` (Markdown's does) can express one perfectly well. What it cannot do is
 * express one from a `newFileTemplate` that carries no `tagName`, so the seed below supplies it —
 * through the format's own serializer, because this module knows no format's syntax.
