/**
 * Library previews — a live document render is expensive, so it is capped, lazy, and evictable.
 *
 * Four limits, each answering a different way the old Manage view fell over on a large project:
 *
 * 1. **Lazy.** A preview is built when its card INTERSECTS the viewport, not when the card is created.
 *    Scrolling a 300-item Library therefore builds a preview per card actually looked at.
 * 2. **Capped.** {@link createPreviewCache} is an LRU with a hard limit. The predecessor's
 *    `_previewCache` was an unbounded `Map<string, HTMLElement>` of live runtime subtrees, so a
 *    long browse leaked every document it had ever shown until the tab closed.
 * 3. **Cancellable.** A preview whose card left the window before its read resolved is dropped on
 *    arrival rather than appended to a detached node.
 * 4. **Released.** The visibility gate keeps a set too, and it is the same leak one level down: a card
 *    observed and then scrolled past before it ever intersected was retained for the life of the
 *    pane. {@link PreviewObserver.releaseDetached} is how the window gives those back.
 *
 * The renders themselves go through `platform.readFile`, which the PAL counts, so `probe.idle()`
 * already knows a preview is in flight without this module declaring an idle source of its own.
