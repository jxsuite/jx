/**
 * The Library's verbs.
 *
 * Every piece of Library state a person can reach is reachable here, which is the difference
 * between this and the Manage view it replaces. That view's category filter, its search box and its
 * grid/table switch existed ONLY as buttons inside a modal, so `scripts/screenshots/automation.ts`
 * carried a hand-maintained `BROWSE_CATEGORY_LABELS` table and pressed the buttons through an XPath
 * matched on their rendered text — plan §13's exact complaint. `library.setCategory` is the same
 * action the button runs, and the button is now a rendering of the record.
 *
 * Every setter is idempotent and names the STATE it reaches, never a delta: there is no
 * `library.toggleLayout`, because a toggle against unstated state is what silently inverted
 * eighteen manifest steps when a default flipped.
