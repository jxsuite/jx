/**
 * Automation.ts — the scripting surface, as a PROJECTION of the app.
 *
 * Installed as `window.__jxAutomation` only when the page URL carries `?automation=1`. It exposes
 * exactly three members (spec studio.md §13.5):
 *
 * - `run(id, args)` — **is** `registry.run(id, args)`, behind {@link isScriptable}. There is no
 *   second action table. A hand-maintained parallel list of what the app can do is what §13 defines
 *   as a defect, and this module used to be 39 entries of exactly that, 16 of them holding raw
 *   XPath into the shell and three of them matching RENDERED TEXT.
 * - `seed(id, args)` — the {@link SEEDS} registry, under the **Remote Rule**: a seed may only write
 *   state whose real writer is a network or IPC boundary. It stands in for a remote, never for a
 *   user. {@link REFUSED_SEEDS} names what that excludes and why.
 * - `probe` — read-only. {@link AutomationProbe.idle} (the predicate that replaced 115 sleeps),
 *   `state()` (the full `CommandContext`), `commands()`, `seeds()`, and `pointAt`/`revealPath`,
 *   which compose the app's own transforms and answer in top-document coordinates.
 *
 * **What is deliberately absent**, each a normative refusal in studio.md §13.5:
 *
 * 1. No method that takes a selector. If a script cannot say it in command ids and `JxPath`s, it
 *    cannot say it here.
 * 2. No `setStatus`. Staging the word "Ready" over the status bar is lying to the reader; if a capture
 *    needs a calm status bar, the app has to BE calm.
 * 3. No `toggle*`. A delta against unstated state is what silently inverted 23 manifest steps when the
 *    assistant's default flipped, and an agent calling `view.toggleAssistant` is guessing at state
 *    it cannot observe. {@link TOGGLE_ID} refuses them at runtime.
 * 4. No compatibility shim. The predecessor carried `setRightTab`'s `if (tab === "assistant")`
 *    redirect, whose own comment said it existed "to keep the Screenshot-manifest verb working" — a
 *    pipeline artefact living in production code.
 * 5. No presentation-state pokes. Automation mutates documents by running the commands a user runs, so
 *    every write goes through the transaction log.

 * matcher and both label mirrors are gone, and `run()` never consults this map to decide what to DO
 * — only to explain, when the registry refuses an id, which of the three fates that id has.
 *
 * This is a countdown, in the idiom of the checker's own `TOGGLE_DEBT`: it may only shrink. It went
 * 39 → 8 when the manifest converted, and 8 → 7 when `element.insertData` became `insert.data`
 * (`canvas/canvas-render.ts`). What left: every `seed` entry, now read off {@link seedIds} and
 * answered from the live registry rather than from a hand-kept list; every `toggle*` entry, which
 * {@link TOGGLE_ID} refuses before this map is ever consulted; and every `command` entry whose
 * record has since landed.
 *
 * What is left is two kinds. Two `command` entries are the manifest's real registry gaps — each
 * reached today by an `input` step clicking a hand-stamped region, and each of those steps carries
 * an `unstable` hatch naming the phase that lands the record, so this map and that hatch count are
 * the same debt. Five `refused` entries are NOT a countdown: they are §13.5's normative refusals,
 * and they stay so that a caller reaching for one gets the reason instead of "unknown command".
