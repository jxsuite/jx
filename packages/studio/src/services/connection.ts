/**
 * The backend connection, said out loud.
 *
 * Only one launcher can lose a backend mid-session: the chromium desktop shell holds a single
 * long-lived WebSocket to its project server. When that socket died, every later call returned a
 * promise that NEVER SETTLED — `WebSocket.send()` on a closed socket discards the frame instead of
 * throwing, so nothing rejected, nothing resolved, and the visible symptom was **Open Project**
 * doing nothing at all. No toast, no log, no failed state. Restarting Studio was the only
 * recovery.
 *
 * The transport now rejects those calls, and this is the other half: a person needs to be told
 * which of "it is broken" and "it is coming back" they are in. One keyed problem so a flapping
 * connection cannot stack up a column of identical rows, dismissed on recovery so a fixed thing
 * does not stay on the Problems list (§16.1's second and third rules: a record is retired when what
 * it names is fixed, and a repeat is not a new row).
 *
 * A platform without `subscribeConnection` — the dev server, electrobun — installs nothing. There
 * is no connection to lose there, and a notice about one would be a lie.
 *
 * @docs studio/interface/problems-and-progress
