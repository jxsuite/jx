/**
 * Clock — the one seam every _relative_ time in Studio reads "now" through.
 *
 * Four surfaces render a duration rather than an instant: the Source Control panel's commit ages
 * and "last refreshed", the Start pane's "last opened", the chat session list's row times, and the
 * recents list those two read from. Each of them called `Date.now()` inline, which had two costs:
 *
 * 1. **They were untestable.** A formatter that reads the wall clock can only be asserted against an
 *    offset from the real present, so "yesterday" and "over a year ago" were never covered.
 * 2. **They drift.** Two captures of the same state minutes apart legitimately read `01:59 PM` and
 *    `02:04 PM` (the shot contract's Determinism section measured exactly that on the git-panel
 *    shot).
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT a global `Date.now` override. Monaco, every `setTimeout`, the collab
 * clock and the transaction log all read the real clock and must keep reading it — pinning time for
 * the whole realm hangs the editor. Four imports, four honest readers.
 *
 * `pinClock` is also what makes session restore's "last opened" honest: the value written is the
 * value the formatter reads back.
