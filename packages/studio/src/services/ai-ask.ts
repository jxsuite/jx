/**
 * Ai-ask.ts — the assistant's one way to stop and put a question to the author.
 *
 * The agent loop `await`s `toolRegistry.execute` (`services/tool-executor.ts`), so a tool that
 * returns a pending promise suspends the turn. That is the whole mechanism: `ask_user` registers a
 * question, hands back a promise, and the panel resolves it when the human answers. No new chat
 * status, no pre-execution hook, and nothing in the published `@jxsuite/ai` changes —
 * `finishStream` has already set the state to `"idle"` by the time tools run, so a suspended turn
 * is idle by construction and this store is what "waiting" means.
 *
 * Two decisions are load-bearing and easy to get wrong on a rewrite:
 *
 * - **A skip is a SUCCESS.** "You decide" is a real answer to a question; only a stopped turn is a
 *   failure. Reporting a skip as an error would make the model apologise for having asked.
 * - **The answer never becomes a user message.** `toMessagesArray` serialises the array verbatim
 *   and a provider requires a `tool` reply to follow its `tool_calls` request; a user turn spliced
 *   between them is a 400. The answer travels as the tool result, and the chat view renders it into
 *   the question's own chip.
 *
 * Exactly one question can be outstanding, because `runAgentLoop` executes a round's tool calls
 * serially. The guard below is defensive, not load-bearing.
