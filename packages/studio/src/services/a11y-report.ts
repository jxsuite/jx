/**
 * Accessibility checks over the document an author is editing — ATAG 2.0 Part B.
 *
 * ATAG splits into two parts, and only one of them was answered here. Part A is "is the authoring
 * tool itself accessible" — the live region, the dialog roles, the focus rings. **Part B is "does
 * the tool help authors produce accessible content"**, and nothing in Studio did: an author could
 * ship a page of unlabelled images and untitled links, and the editor said nothing at all.
 *
 * Three deliberate shapes, all copied from surfaces that already work here:
 *
 * - **No score.** `head-panel.ts` argues this for SEO and the argument transfers verbatim: a single
 *   figure out of a hundred aggregates unrelated facts into a verdict, and the verdict is what gets
 *   optimised. A named list of things that are wrong is the report.
 * - **Each finding names its criterion, and where it can, a command that REPAIRS it.** That second
 *   half is B.3.2 rather than B.3.1 — checking is only half of what the standard asks, and a
 *   finding an author cannot act on from where they are told about it is a finding they will not
 *   act on.
 * - **A check that could not run says so.** `redirects-grid.ts` files an explicit "this run could not
 *   check X" Problem rather than reporting a clean bill, because a report that silently passes what
 *   it could not inspect is worse than no report.
 *
 * **What is deliberately not here.** Colour contrast between computed colours, target size in
 * rendered pixels, reading order, focus order, and anything else that depends on layout or the
 * cascade. Those are properties of _built output_ in a browser, not of a document tree — checking
 * them means running the page and axe-core over it, which is a different program with a different
 * lifetime. `unavailableChecks()` names them so the absence is stated rather than implied.
 *
 * **The structural rules live in `@jxsuite/schema/a11y`** — an unnamed control, an image with no
 * alt, an aria reference to an id nothing has, a tab, menu item or option outside its container, a
 * tablist with no selected tab, an unnamed dialog, aria-activedescendant on an element that cannot
 * take focus — so `jx validate`, the kit's conformance tests and this report judge a document alike
 * (spec §8.8). What stays here is what needs the whole page rather than a node: the heading
 * outline, duplicate ids, the document language, link wording, autocomplete purposes and media.
