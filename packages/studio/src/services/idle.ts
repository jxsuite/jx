/**
 * Idle.ts — "settled" is a predicate, and it can fail.
 *
 * One question — _has Studio finished reacting?_ — asked of the five subsystems that can still be
 * mid-flight, over two consecutive animation frames (spec studio.md §13.5, plan §13.4).
 *
 * **The rejection is the point.** The thing this replaces is 115 `wait: {ms}` steps totalling 73
 * seconds, and a sleep cannot fail: a subsystem that was slow that day got answered with `+500 ms`
 * and the wrong state was photographed, committed and accepted. {@link NotIdleError} carries a
 * `blockedBy` array naming every outstanding item — `["canvas[page-1]: gen 7 unacked", "platform: 1
 * in-flight (gitStatus)"]` — so the slow subsystem identifies itself.
 *
 * Nothing here polls a subsystem it does not own. Each source is a function the owning module
 * already had to write for its own reasons.
 *
 * There WAS a seventh, `panel-scheduler.pendingSchedulers()`, and it went with the scheduler. It
 * reported a panel with an animation frame queued or a render withheld while a field had focus —
 * both facts about a lit dock repainting itself. The Navigator and the Inspector are documents now
 * (`surfaces/navigator-dock.json`, `surfaces/inspector-dock.json`): a projection is written
 * synchronously and a binding whose value did not move writes nothing, so there is no queued frame
 * to be outstanding and no withheld render to wait for. The panel bodies that ARE still lit are
 * painted synchronously from the same call.
 *
 * 1. `store.rendersInFlight()` — renderers mid-paint.
 * 2. `iframe-host.canvasIdleBlockers()` — per host: unacked generations and patches, plus the frame's
 *    own cross-realm report of fonts, running animations and pending image retries.
 * 3. `platform.platformInFlight()` — unsettled PAL calls, counted at the one seam every adapter and
 *    all thirty-odd `git*`/fs/fetch methods pass through.
 * 4. `layers.overlayIdleBlockers()` — overlays still in transition. Only the SETTLING window counts: a
 *    resting toast is not a blocker, which is what lets `toastsAreHeld()` hold one open for a
 *    capture without `probeIdle()` waiting forever alongside it (plan §13.7's named exception).
 * 5. `activity-panel.activityIdleBlockers()` — operations still RUNNING in the Activity tab. Not a
 *    duplicate of `platform`: an activity spans a whole operation (an install, a deploy, a clone)
 *    across many PAL calls, so the gaps between them look quiet at the seam while the operation is
 *    plainly mid-flight. A finished entry never blocks — the list stays on screen forever.
 * 6. `grid-idle.gridIdleBlockers()` — tables still building, or built but not yet showing the
 *    selection range `selectableRange: 1` gives them. Nothing else covered Tabulator: a grid
 *    command resolves when the panel mounts, which is several frames before the table is drawn.
 *
 * The consumers are the `packages/studio:verify` skill, the screenshot runner and P4.2's Activity
 * tracker (this is a read-only projection of the same in-flight set that dock renders).
