/**
 * Popover correctness over the document an author is editing.
 *
 * A second document report beside the accessibility one, and separate from it on purpose: an
 * `A11yFinding` is typed to a WCAG criterion, and none of these are WCAG failures. A popover whose
 * base rule sets `display` is not inaccessible, it is BROKEN — laid out on every page whether or
 * not anyone opened it — and forcing that into a criterion field would be a lie in the report's own
 * vocabulary. `popover-unnamed` is the one finding that genuinely IS a WCAG matter, and it belongs
 * to `a11y-report.ts` rather than here.
 *
 * The rules themselves live in `@jxsuite/schema/overlays`, not in this file. Three surfaces judge
 * the same documents — this report, `jx build`, and the starter conformance test — and three copies
 * of "what is wrong with a popover" is three chances for them to disagree with each other in front
 * of an author.
 *
 * **Every finding that can be repaired carries the command that repairs it** (ATAG 2.0 B.3.2), and
 * the ones that cannot carry none. "Point this invoker at the right panel" has no mechanical answer
 * — which panel is the author's decision — so that finding is a sentence, not a button. A button
 * that does not do what it says is worse than no button.
