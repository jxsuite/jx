/**
 * Ai-import-tools.ts — `import_site`, the assistant's other way to bootstrap a project.
 *
 * A sibling of `create_project` (`ai-project-tools.ts`) with a different backend: it drives whatever
 * import pipeline the platform's `importSite` reaches — a local headless Chrome, or a hosted one —
 * streams its progress into a record the transcript draws, and then adopts the result exactly as a
 * scaffold is adopted. Its own module
 * rather than an eighth tool in `ai-project-tools.ts`, which is already 650 lines under a per-file
 * coverage bar.
 *
 * Two things it does NOT do are the point:
 *
 * - **It does not invent a destination.** `create_project` requires the model to supply `location`
 *   and refuses without one — correct when a bare chat bootstraps a project, a regression on the
 *   wizard path where the Location field already has a folder picker, validation and a live preview.
 *   The destination comes from the pending brief; a model-supplied one must match it.
 * - **It does not decide what the crawl found.** The pipeline is one-way: it reports and finishes.
 *   Everything worth a human's opinion — which skipped pages matter, whether the components it
 *   extracted are really components — is in the summary for the model to raise with `ask_user`
 *   AFTERWARDS, against real numbers rather than a guess made before the browser launched.
