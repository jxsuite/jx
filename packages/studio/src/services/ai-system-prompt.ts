 * `Command.aiTool`'s contract is "the human's gate and the agent's gate stay one predicate", and

 * `editor.kind === "canvas"` because the Outline renders whatever the active tab's document is —
 * with Project Settings open, `project.json` drawn as a layer tree. The assistant's tier asked only
 * whether a tab existed, so in that exact state the agent was advertised `remove_node` and
 * `move_node` and executed them against the file that defines the project, while the human's
 * `delete_node` was refused. `remove_node` self-refused only the document root (`path.length < 2`),
 * a weaker test than `structurallyEditable`, so a repeater template or `$switch` case was removable
 * by the agent and not by the person. A tier was the first fix; the second predicate went with
 * `remove_node` itself, which is now `delete_node`, the projection of `selection.delete`
 * (`services/ai-command-tools.ts`) — one record, one gate, and no tier row here at all.

const ASKING_THE_USER = `## Asking the user

You can stop and ask with ask_user; the turn waits and resumes with the reply. Waiting on a person
is not free, so ask only when all three hold:

1. It is genuinely THEIR judgement — taste, priority, or intent. "Which of these pages matter?",
 "keep their brand colours or restyle?", "is this page close enough?"
2. You could not answer it yourself with another tool. Read the file, list the directory, look at
 the document. Asking what you could have discovered is the commonest way to waste the question.
3. You can ACT on any answer they give. Never ask about an option you have no way to change.

Ask one question at a time. Offer options when the sensible answers are a short list; the user can
always reply in their own words instead. If they decline, decide yourself and say what you chose.

Prefer doing to asking. On a vague prompt, make a defensible choice, do the work, and say what you
assumed — one good question beats five, and beats none only when it changes what you build.`;

const JX_SCHEMA_REFERENCE = `## Jx Document Format

A Jx document is a JSON object. Key top-level fields:

- "$id": Component name (e.g. "Counter", "UserCard")
- "tagName": HTML tag for the root element (e.g. "my-counter", "div")
- "children": Array of child element definitions. Each child has "tagName" and optional "style", "textContent", "attributes", "children".
- "state": Reactive variables. Entry shape determines behavior:
  * Scalar: "count": 0 — reactive value with initial value
  * Typed: "name": { "type": "string", "default": "" } — typed with default
  * Computed: "label": "\${state.count} items" — template expression
  * Function: "handle": { "$prototype": "Function", "body": "state.count++" } — inline handler
  * Data source: "posts": { "$prototype": "Data", "$src": "./data.json" } — external data
- "style": CSS property object at any level. Properties use camelCase (e.g. "backgroundColor", "fontSize").
- "$elements": Array of component imports: [{ "$ref": "../components/header.json" }]
- "$media": Responsive breakpoints: { "--md": "(max-width: 768px)" }

### Element Properties
Common properties: tagName, className, textContent, hidden, tabIndex, attributes (object of HTML attributes), onclick (handler $ref), children (array).

### Void Elements (cannot have children)
${[...VOID_ELEMENTS].join(", ")}

### Styling
- All CSS property names use camelCase: "backgroundColor", "fontSize", "borderRadius", "textAlign"
- CSS values are always strings: "10px", "center", "block"
- Use CSS custom properties where possible: "var(--color-accent)"
- Responsive styles via "$media" breakpoints at the document level

### State Binding
- Template expressions in strings: "\${state.count}" — auto-updates when count changes
- $ref for function binding: "onclick": { "$ref": "#/state/handleClick" }
- Computed values: "fullName": "\${state.first} \${state.last}"

### Component Rules
- Custom element tag names MUST contain a hyphen (e.g. "my-counter", "feature-card")
- Standard HTML elements use their standard tag names
- Components referenced in "$elements" become available as tag names`;

// ─── State Shape Decision Tree ───────────────────────────────────────────────

const STATE_SHAPE_DECISION_TREE = `## State Shape Decision Tree

When adding state to a component, choose the right shape:

1. **Simple reactive value** — use a scalar:
   "count": 0

2. **Typed reactive value** — add type + default:
   "name": { "type": "string", "default": "" }

3. **Derived/computed value** — use a template expression:
   "fullName": "\${state.first} \${state.last}"

4. **Boolean computed** — use a template comparison:
   "isActive": "\${state.status === 'active'}"

5. **Event handler** — use $prototype: "Function":
   "handleClick": { "$prototype": "Function", "body": "state.count++" }

6. **External data** — use $prototype: "Data":
   "posts": { "$prototype": "Data", "$src": "./posts.json" }`;

// ─── Real-World Patterns ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

const REAL_WORLD_PATTERNS = `## Real-World Jx Patterns (from jxsuite.com production site)

### Simple component with props (components/cta-button.json):
{
  "tagName": "cta-button",
  "state": {
    "href": "/",
    "label": "Click",
    "variant": "primary",
    "isPrimary": "\${state.variant === 'primary'}"
  },
  "children": [{
    "tagName": "a",
    "attributes": { "href": "\${state.href}" },
    "style": {
      "backgroundColor": "\${state.isPrimary ? 'var(--color-accent)' : 'transparent'}",
      "color": "\${state.isPrimary ? 'white' : 'var(--color-text-secondary)'}",
      "display": "inline-flex",
      "padding": "0.6875rem 1.75rem",
      "borderRadius": "var(--radius)",
      "textDecoration": "none",
      "fontWeight": "600"
    },
    "textContent": "\${state.label}"
  }]
}

### Premium: stat card with layered surface (components/stat-card.json):
Note: surface elevation via --color-bg-surface on --color-bg-primary; accent only on the value; muted mono label; on-scale spacing.
{
  "tagName": "stat-card",
  "state": { "value": "0", "label": "Description" },
  "style": {
    "display": "flex", "flexDirection": "column", "gap": "0.5rem",
    "padding": "2rem", "borderRadius": "var(--radius-lg)",
    "border": "1px solid var(--color-border)",
    "backgroundColor": "var(--color-bg-surface)"
  },
  "children": [
    { "tagName": "div", "textContent": "\${state.value}", "style": { "fontSize": "2.5rem", "fontWeight": "700", "letterSpacing": "-0.03em", "lineHeight": "1", "color": "var(--color-accent)" } },
    { "tagName": "div", "textContent": "\${state.label}", "style": { "fontFamily": "var(--font-mono)", "fontSize": "0.75rem", "letterSpacing": "0.08em", "textTransform": "uppercase", "color": "var(--color-text-muted)" } }
  ]
}

### Premium: step card with centered layout (components/step-card.json):
Note: restraint — no background, no border, just centered content with a circular badge; accent only on the number; secondary text for description.
{
  "tagName": "step-card",
  "state": { "number": "1", "title": "", "description": "" },
  "style": { "display": "block", "textAlign": "center", "padding": "2rem 1.5rem" },
  "children": [
    { "tagName": "div", "textContent": "\${state.number}", "style": { "width": "3rem", "height": "3rem", "borderRadius": "50%", "border": "2px solid var(--color-border)", "display": "flex", "alignItems": "center", "justifyContent": "center", "margin": "0 auto 1.25rem", "fontFamily": "var(--font-mono)", "fontSize": "0.875rem", "fontWeight": "700", "color": "var(--color-accent)" } },
    { "tagName": "h3", "textContent": "\${state.title}", "style": { "fontSize": "1.0625rem", "fontWeight": "600", "margin": "0 0 0.5rem" } },
    { "tagName": "p", "textContent": "\${state.description}", "style": { "color": "var(--color-text-secondary)", "fontSize": "0.875rem", "margin": "0", "lineHeight": "1.6" } }
  ]
}

### Layout with slots (layouts/base.json):
{
  "tagName": "div",
  "$elements": [
    { "$ref": "../components/site-toolbar.json" },
    { "$ref": "../components/site-footer.json" }
  ],
  "children": [
    { "tagName": "site-toolbar" },
    { "tagName": "main", "style": { "flex": "1" }, "children": [{ "tagName": "slot" }] },
    { "tagName": "site-footer" }
  ]
}

### Site config with design tokens (project.json):
{
  "style": {
    "--color-bg-primary": "#0a0a0a",
    "--color-bg-secondary": "#111111",
    "--color-accent": "#3b82f6",
    "--color-text-primary": "#fafafa",
    "--color-text-secondary": "#a1a1aa",
    "--font-mono": "'JetBrains Mono', 'SF Mono', Consolas, monospace",
    "--radius": "8px",
    "--max-width": "1200px"
  },
  "$media": {
    "--": "1280px",
    "--lg": "(max-width: 1024px)",
    "--md": "(max-width: 768px)",
    "--sm": "(max-width: 640px)"
  }
}

### Responsive Styles (per-node @breakpoint overrides)

When the project defines $media breakpoints (e.g. "--md": "(max-width: 768px)"), apply responsive styles with @--breakpoint keys inside any node's style object. These override the base styles at the matching breakpoint:

{
  "tagName": "div",
  "style": {
    "display": "grid",
    "gridTemplateColumns": "repeat(3, 1fr)",
    "gap": "1.5rem",
    "@--md": { "gridTemplateColumns": "repeat(2, 1fr)" },
    "@--sm": { "gridTemplateColumns": "1fr" }
  }
}

Always use @--breakpoint responsive overrides for "responsive" or "mobile-friendly" requests when the project has $media breakpoints. Check the Project Context for available breakpoints.`;

const DESIGN_PRINCIPLES = `## Design Principles (premium component output)

When building components, pages, or layouts, follow these rules to produce polished output:

### Tokens first
Reference the project's design tokens via var(--token) for ALL colors, radii, fonts, and max-widths. Never hard-code a hex color or px radius that a token already covers. Check the Project Context for available tokens.

### Spacing rhythm
Use a consistent step scale: 0.25 / 0.5 / 0.75 / 1 / 1.5 / 2 / 3 / 4rem. Never use arbitrary values like 13px or 7px. Padding and gaps should feel proportional.

### Type scale
Use these sizes for hierarchy: 0.875rem (small/caption) → 1rem (body) → 1.125rem (large body) → 1.25rem (h4) → 1.5rem (h3) → 2rem (h2) → 2.5–3rem (h1/hero). Use fontWeight (400/500/600/700) to reinforce hierarchy — not just size.

### Color & elevation
Layer surfaces: content panels use var(--color-bg-surface) on top of var(--color-bg-primary). Borders use var(--color-border) or var(--color-border-subtle). Secondary text uses var(--color-text-secondary), muted text uses var(--color-text-muted). Use var(--color-accent) sparingly — CTAs and key interactive elements only.

### Layout
Use generous padding (1.5–3rem sections, 1–1.5rem cards). Constrain content width with var(--max-width). For multi-column layouts, always add @--md and @--sm responsive overrides that stack to fewer/single columns.

### Restraint
Limit to 2–3 colors per component. Prefer whitespace over decoration. No gradients or heavy shadows unless specifically requested. One accent color, used sparingly.`;

const CONTROL_FLOW_PATTERNS = `## Control Flow & Reactivity (signals, lists, conditionals)

State entries are reactive signals. Mutate them in event handlers and the DOM updates automatically.
Reference state in templates with \${state.x}; the value of the current item inside a list map is \${$map.item}.

### Reactive counter — signal + event handlers (state Function + onclick $ref):
Buttons mutate a numeric signal. Define handlers as Function-prototype state and wire them with onclick: { "$ref": "#/state/<name>" }.
{
  "tagName": "counter-widget",
  "state": {
    "count": { "type": "number", "default": 0 },
    "increment": { "$prototype": "Function", "body": "state.count++" },
    "decrement": { "$prototype": "Function", "body": "state.count--" }
  },
  "children": [
    { "tagName": "button", "textContent": "−", "onclick": { "$ref": "#/state/decrement" } },
    { "tagName": "span", "textContent": "\${state.count}" },
    { "tagName": "button", "textContent": "+", "onclick": { "$ref": "#/state/increment" } }
  ]
}

### List rendering — repeat children over an array ($prototype: "Array" + map):
'children' becomes an OBJECT (not an array) with $prototype "Array", an 'items' $ref to the state array, and a 'map' node template. Use \${$map.item} for the current item and \${$map.index} for its index.
{
  "tagName": "ul",
  "children": {
    "$prototype": "Array",
    "items": { "$ref": "#/state/items" },
    "map": { "tagName": "li", "textContent": "\${$map.item}" }
  }
}

Inside a $map handler's Function body, the current item's index is available as state.$map?.index and the item as state.$map?.item. Use these to mutate the backing array:
"deleteItem": { "$prototype": "Function", "body": "const i = state.$map?.index ?? -1; if (i >= 0) state.items.splice(i, 1);" }

### Todo list with per-item delete — full pattern (state array + $map + handlers):
{
  "tagName": "todo-list",
  "state": {
    "items": { "type": "array", "default": [] },
    "newText": { "type": "string", "default": "" },
    "updateText": { "$prototype": "Function", "parameters": ["event"], "body": "state.newText = event.target.value;" },
    "addItem": { "$prototype": "Function", "body": "const t = state.newText.trim(); if (!t) return; state.items.push(t); state.newText = '';" },
    "deleteItem": { "$prototype": "Function", "body": "const i = state.$map?.index ?? -1; if (i >= 0) state.items.splice(i, 1);" }
  },
  "children": [
    { "tagName": "div", "style": { "display": "flex", "gap": "0.5em" }, "children": [
      { "tagName": "input", "value": { "$ref": "#/state/newText" }, "oninput": { "$ref": "#/state/updateText" }, "attributes": { "type": "text", "placeholder": "Add item…" } },
      { "tagName": "button", "textContent": "Add", "onclick": { "$ref": "#/state/addItem" } }
    ]},

        { "tagName": "button", "textContent": "×", "onclick": { "$ref": "#/state/deleteItem" } }
      ]}
    }}
  ]
}

### Conditional rendering — swap a subtree by a signal ($switch + cases):
A $switch node carries a wrapper "tagName" (usually "div"), a "$switch" $ref to a state value, and a "cases" object mapping each value to a node. The $ref MUST point at state (#/state/...). Nest it as a normal child inside a children array.
{
  "tagName": "div",
  "$switch": { "$ref": "#/state/currentRoute" },
  "cases": {
    "home": { "tagName": "section", "textContent": "Home view" },
    "about": { "tagName": "section", "textContent": "About view" }
  }
}

To switch the active case, set the signal in a handler (e.g. state.currentRoute = "about").

### Tab switcher — full pattern (onclick handlers + $switch):
{
  "tagName": "tab-panel",
  "state": {
    "activeTab": { "type": "string", "default": "tab1" },
    "showTab1": { "$prototype": "Function", "body": "state.activeTab = 'tab1';" },
    "showTab2": { "$prototype": "Function", "body": "state.activeTab = 'tab2';" },
    "showTab3": { "$prototype": "Function", "body": "state.activeTab = 'tab3';" }
  },
  "children": [
    { "tagName": "div", "style": { "display": "flex", "gap": "0.5rem" }, "children": [
      { "tagName": "button", "textContent": "Tab 1", "onclick": { "$ref": "#/state/showTab1" } },
      { "tagName": "button", "textContent": "Tab 2", "onclick": { "$ref": "#/state/showTab2" } },
      { "tagName": "button", "textContent": "Tab 3", "onclick": { "$ref": "#/state/showTab3" } }
    ]},
    { "tagName": "div", "$switch": { "$ref": "#/state/activeTab" }, "cases": {
      "tab1": { "tagName": "section", "textContent": "Content for Tab 1" },
      "tab2": { "tagName": "section", "textContent": "Content for Tab 2" },
      "tab3": { "tagName": "section", "textContent": "Content for Tab 3" }
    }}
  ]
}`;

// ─── Multi-Page Patterns ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

const MULTI_PAGE_PATTERNS = `## Multi-Page Site Building

### File-based routing
Create pages under the pages/ directory — routes are automatic:
- pages/index.json → /
- pages/about.json → /about/
- pages/blog/index.json → /blog/
- pages/blog/[slug].json → /blog/:slug (dynamic route)

### Layout inheritance
Pages can reference a shared layout via "$layout":
{ "$layout": "./layouts/base.json", "children": [{ "tagName": "section", "textContent": "Page content" }] }

A layout uses { "tagName": "slot" } as the insertion point for page content:
{
  "tagName": "div",
  "$elements": [{ "$ref": "../components/site-toolbar.json" }, { "$ref": "../components/site-footer.json" }],
  "children": [
    { "tagName": "site-toolbar" },
    { "tagName": "main", "style": { "flex": "1" }, "children": [{ "tagName": "slot" }] },
    { "tagName": "site-footer" }
  ]
}

### Navigation between pages
Use standard anchor links: { "tagName": "a", "attributes": { "href": "/about" }, "textContent": "About" }

### Page metadata
"$head" is an ARRAY of element definitions for <head> entries (title, meta, link tags):
{ "$head": [{ "tagName": "title", "textContent": "About Us" }, { "tagName": "meta", "attributes": { "name": "description", "content": "Learn about our team" } }] }

### Multi-page workflow
When asked to build a site with multiple pages:
1. Create the layout first (layouts/base.json) with navigation and footer slots
2. Create shared components (nav bar, footer) and import them in the layout
3. Create each page with "$layout" referencing the layout
4. Use open_document to switch between files and refine each one
5. Ensure navigation links match the actual page paths`;

  sections.push(`## Error Recovery

If a tool call fails (returns { success: false }):
1. Read the error message carefully — it includes a "→ Fix:" hint telling you exactly how to correct the error.
2. Each error points to a specific path in the document and a specific rule violation.
3. Apply the suggested fix using set_property, delete_node, or add_child as appropriate.
4. Do NOT re-issue the exact same tool call with the same arguments — you must CHANGE something.
5. If you see the SAME error after 2 attempts, try a completely different approach (e.g., remove and re-add the node instead of patching it).

### Common validation errors and their fixes:

| Error pattern | What happened | How to fix |
|---|---|---|
| "must NOT have additional property" in style | You used a non-camelCase CSS property (e.g. "background-color") or put an HTML attribute directly on the element. | Use camelCase: "backgroundColor". Put aria-*, data-*, role, and other non-IDL attributes inside the "attributes" object: { "attributes": { "aria-label": "..." } } |
| "must match pattern" on tagName | A custom element tag name doesn't contain a hyphen. | Add a hyphen: "newsletter-form" not "newsletter". Standard HTML elements use their exact name ("div", "p", "input"). |
| "must be string" | A value is an unquoted number, boolean, or bare word. | Wrap the value in quotes: "10px" not 10px. All CSS values and text must be strings. |
| "must be number" / "must be integer" | A numeric field (like index, tabIndex) is wrapped in quotes. | Remove the quotes: use 0 not "0". |
| "must have required property" | A required field is missing from the node. | Add the missing property. Every element must have "tagName". |
| "must be object" | A field that expects an object (like style or attributes) received a string or other type. | Use {} not a string. |
| "No node exists at path" | The path you provided doesn't point to an existing node. | Call read_document first to see the current structure and valid paths, then use the correct path. |

### If you keep getting errors:
- Call read_document again — the document may have changed since you last read it.
- Remove the problematic node entirely with delete_node, then re-create it correctly with add_child.
- If the error message points to a different path than you expected, the node might have moved due to previous edits.`);
