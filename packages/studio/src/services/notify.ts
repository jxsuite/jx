/**
 * Notify.ts — the third record type (plan §1), and the app's only way to say what happened.
 *
 * What this replaces: 78 `statusMessage()` call sites — 26 failures and 52 successes — rendered in
 * identical 11px grey text in a 24px strip and destroyed after 3000 ms. A failure and a save looked
 * the same, neither could be acted on, and both were gone before a reader who had looked away could
 * read them. `statusMessage` is deleted, not wrapped; `scripts/check-styles.ts` bans the name from
 * `src/` so it cannot regrow.
 *
 * **A notification is a record, and its lifetime is chosen by the action it requires** (§7.1):
 *
 * | Tier      | Host                       | Lifetime           | Use when                       |
 * | --------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
 * | `toast`   | the fourth overlay layer   | timed, dismissible | reversible, or needs no action |
 * | `problem` | the Bottom dock's Problems | until it is fixed  | it must be fixed               |
 *
 * §7.1 names a third tier — **inline**, the refusal a field draws at the control (`jx-field`'s own
 * `[part="error"]`, projected by whichever inspector document owns the row). It is deliberately NOT
 * a member of {@link NotificationTier}: an inline error is a value a control renders next to the
 * field the user is editing, not a record the app posts to a host, and it has no store to live in.
 * Declaring a tier here whose only possible outcome is being dropped on the floor would be exactly
 * the silence this module exists to end, so the union has two members and the third tier arrives as
 * a field's own projected value (P4.4).
 *
 * **Recovery is a command id, not a per-call-site closure.** `notify.error("Save failed", { action:
 * "file.save" })` gives the toast and the Problems row a Retry button whose label, availability,
 * disabled reason and keyboard chord all come off the command record — which is why this lives
 * beside the registry rather than inside any one surface. A call site that wanted a Retry used to
 * have to invent a button; now it names a capability that already exists.
 *
 * Nothing here renders. `ui/layers.ts` hosts the toasts and the Bottom dock hosts the Problems
 * list; both read the two reactive arrays below, so a new surface can render notifications without
 * this module learning it exists.
