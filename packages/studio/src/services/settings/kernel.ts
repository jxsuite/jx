/**
 * The settings kernel — one owner for every application setting's value.
 *
 * **The model.** The backend store is authoritative, `localStorage` is a synchronous cache of it,
 * and every write is a per-key patch applied by whoever owns the file. What this replaces collapsed
 * all three roles: `localStorage` was the truth, and it was mirrored to disk by whole-map replaces
 * computed from whichever window happened to write last. On the chromium launcher — where every
 * window is its own process with its own browser profile, and so its own `localStorage` — a window
 * holding no settings could therefore overwrite the shared file with an almost empty map. Nothing
 * told the other window it had happened.
 *
 * **Why a Map and not just localStorage.** Reads must be synchronous: the chrome theme is read
 * before the first paint (`shell.ts` says so explicitly — a mismatch flashes the shell), and every
 * credential gate reads on the render path. But the authoritative copy arrives asynchronously. An
 * in-memory Map seeded from the cache at module evaluation gives both: correct on the first frame,
 * and reconciled by {@link hydrateSettings} the moment the backend answers.
 *
 * **The one deletion path.** {@link setSetting} with `""` STORES an empty string;
 * {@link clearSetting} is the only thing that removes. Blank used to mean delete, which read as a
 * convenience until a form that blanked its own drafts on save called the setters with them — and
 * pressing Save a second time revoked the credentials the first press had stored. Making blank
 * unrepresentable as a deletion is what stops that whole class, rather than fixing the one caller.
