/**
 * Ai-writes.ts — what the assistant changed, per turn, and whether you can take it back.
 *
 * §7.4 (AI honesty). Two facts about an assistant turn were legible only to the model:
 *
 * 1. **Which files it changed.** The loop collected `result.summary` strings and fed them back into
 *    the conversation; the human got a paragraph of prose in which "I updated the hero" and "I
 *    rewrote layouts/base.json" are the same shape of sentence.
 * 2. **Which of those changes undo can reach.** Document tools mutate through `transactDoc`, so ⌘Z
 *    covers them. `write_file` and `write_project_config` go straight to disk through the platform,
 *    where there is no history and never was — and the caveat was appended to the MODEL-facing tool
 *    summary, telling the party that cannot press ⌘Z and not the party that can.
 *
 * A ledger rather than a parse of the summaries, because a summary is prose the model reads and a
 * ledger is a record the UI renders — deriving one from the other would make the panel's honesty
 * depend on the wording of a sentence written for somebody else.
 *
 * The tools record; the loop bounds the turn; the panel renders. Nothing here knows about lit, and
 * nothing here imports the loop, so a tool can be honest without either.
