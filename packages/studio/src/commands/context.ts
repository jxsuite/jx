/**
 * Context.ts — the record every `when` / `enablement` predicate closes over.
 *
 * One flat-ish record of the facts a command can be gated on (specs/studio.md §13.4). Predicates
 * are plain closures over this record — the shape `services/gated-registry.ts` already ships for
 * the AI's tools — not a serialisable string DSL, which the shell redesign rejected explicitly: a
 * `"project.open && editor.kind == 'canvas'"` grammar needs a tokenizer, a parser and a reactive
 * evaluator to buy serialisability nothing in Studio consumes.
 *
 * This module owns the SHAPE and a pure builder. It deliberately imports nothing from the state
 * modules: the registry takes a `getContext()` thunk, so wiring the live sources (the reactive
 * `shell` record, `workspace`, `activeTab`) is a next-wave change to one function, and every test
 * here builds its own context with {@link makeContext} instead of standing up the app.
 *
 * `capability.*` mirrors the Platform Abstraction Layer so cloud / desktop / dev-server differences
 * stop being `if (platform.x)` scattered across templates and become one `when` clause per
 * command.
 *
 * {@link keyScopeStack} lives here for the same reason: it is a pure function of this record, so
 * the keyboard's "where am I" question is answered by the same facts every `when` predicate reads,
 * rather than by a second set of `if (canvasMode === …)` branches in the listener.
