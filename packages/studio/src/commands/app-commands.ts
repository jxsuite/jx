/**
 * App-commands.ts — the whole app's command set, in one bare-Bun-importable place.
 *
 * `src/studio.ts` composes the registry a RUNNING window uses, by calling each module's
 * `registerXCommands(registry, deps)` beside the state it writes. That is the right shape for the
 * app and the wrong shape for CI: `scripts/check-command-levels.ts`,
 * `scripts/check-chrome-budget.ts` and `scripts/check-shot-contract.ts` all run in a bare Bun
 * process with no DOM and no bootstrap, and each looks for one export — `defaultCommandSet()`.
 *
 * Without this module those three checks see only `commands/defaults.ts`'s sixteen records, which
 * is why plan §13.5's headline promise was not yet true: a manifest step naming `view.setActivity`
 * with a panel id the registry does not declare sailed through Lane 1, because Lane 1 could not
 * load the record that declares the enum. Every module gathered below imports cleanly with no
 * `document` and no `localStorage` write, which is the ONLY property this file requires of them —
 * and the test beside it asserts exactly that, so a future DOM read at module scope fails here
 * rather than in CI.
 *
 * **Deps are the no-op set.** Nothing here runs a command; the checks read `id`, `level`, `menus`
 * and `args`. Passing real implementations would mean importing the app.
 *
 * **The canvas keyboard is here now.** This note used to say `editor/shortcuts.ts`'s records were
 * deliberately absent because `edit.copy` / `edit.cut` were declared in two places, and that they
 * would join "when that reconciliation lands — one line each, and no script changes". The
 * reconciliation had already landed (`shortcuts.ts`'s handoff table records it as PAID: the
 * clipboard pair is defined once, in `editor/context-menu.ts`, and spread from there), so the
 * deferral outlived its reason by two phases while ten records the app runs stayed invisible to
 * every check and to the generated keyboard sheet. It was one line. `tests/
 * app-commands-composition.test.ts` now asserts the projection from BOTH directions, because a
 * record the app registers and the projection omits is exactly as invisible as the reverse, and
 * only one of the two had a guard.
