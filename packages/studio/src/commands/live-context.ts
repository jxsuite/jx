/**
 * Live-context.ts — the running app's answer to `getContext()`.
 *
 * `context.ts` owns the SHAPE and refuses to import a state module, which is what lets the CI
 * checks load the command set in a bare Bun process. This file is the other half: it reads the
 * three places state actually lives — the reactive `shell` record, `workspace` / `activeTab`, and
 * `projectState` — and projects them onto that shape, once per predicate evaluation.
 *
 * **A fresh snapshot per call, deliberately.** The registry calls `getContext()` inside
 * `visible()`, `isEnabled()` and `run()`, so a surface that repaints from an effect reads
 * `shell.focusRegion`, `activeTab.value` and the tab's session THROUGH this builder while that
 * effect is collecting dependencies — the effect therefore tracks them and re-runs when they
 * change. Caching the record would be the one change that breaks that, and there is nothing to
 * cache: every field is a property read or a `typeof fn === "function"` test.
 *
 * The recorded pitfall for reactive state — build nested collections complete BEFORE inserting
 * them, because writes through a raw ref skip effects — does not bite here for the same reason: the
 * returned record is a plain, complete, throwaway object. It is never made reactive and never
 * mutated after construction.
 *
 * Four facts arrive by injection rather than by import: the canvas mode (owned by `studio.ts`), the
 * caret and modal flags (`canvas/iframe-host.ts`, `ui/layers.ts`) and the platform. Injecting them
 * keeps this module free of the import cycle studio.ts → shortcuts.ts → live-context.ts →
 * studio.ts, and lets a test state a context without standing up the app.

 * instead of part of the event, so a `when` predicate can read it too.
 *
 * The selector also named `sp-textfield`, `sp-search`, `sp-number-field` and `sp-picker`, and it
 * had to: a Spectrum control's real `<input>` lives in a SHADOW ROOT, so both the event's target
 * and `document.activeElement` retarget onto the custom element, and the native entries never saw
 * it. The kit declares no shadow root anywhere (`ui.md` §3.2), so `jx-textfield`, `jx-select` and
 * `jx-number-field` each put their native control in the caller's own tree and `activeElement` IS
 * that control. Nothing was substituted for the four, because the answer comes one node deeper and
 * `input, textarea, select` was always the entry that would give it.
