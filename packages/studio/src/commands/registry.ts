/**
 * Registry.ts — one definition site per action.
 *
 * A {@link Command} is the whole record of a capability: its name, its containment level, the
 * predicate that decides whether it is available, the one sentence that says why it is not, its
 * default chord, and the surfaces it belongs in. Every surface — Command Bar, palette, rail,
 * context menus, the block action bar, the keymap, `__jxAutomation` and the assistant's tools —
 * becomes a RENDERING of these records. A surface may choose whether to show a command; it may
 * never decide what it is called, when it is available, or what it does (plan §2, principle 1).
 *
 * Three things fail loudly at registration rather than degrading into a surface disagreement:
 *
 * - A duplicate id — the second definition site the whole design exists to prevent;
 * - A chord already claimed in the same `keyScope` (see `keymap.ts`) — this is exactly how ⌘W came to
 *   disagree with the tab strip's × button;
 * - A `menus` placement the level × placement matrix does not admit (see `levels.ts`), so a
 *   selection-level verb cannot appear in the Command Bar even in a hand-written test app.
 *
 * `when` / `enablement` are `(ctx) => boolean` closures, modelled on the shipped
 * `services/gated-registry.ts` `ToolAvailability`, and `requires` is ONE string with three
 * consumers: the disabled control's tooltip, the palette row's grey subtitle and the agent's
 * refusal message. Plan §13 rejects a serialisable string DSL; do not add one.
 *
 * The registry takes its context by injection (`getContext`), so nothing here imports a state
 * module. That is what lets the CI checks import the command set in a bare Bun process and lets
 * every test build the exact state it wants to assert against.
