/**
 * Levels.ts — the containment taxonomy and the level × placement matrix.
 *
 * Two vocabularies live here, and keeping them apart is the whole point (specs/studio.md
 * §13.2–§13.3):
 *
 * - {@link Level} answers WHAT a record acts on. It governs placement and is CI-checked.
 * - {@link KeyScope} answers WHERE a chord is live. It governs keyboard dispatch only.
 *
 * Conflating them is how "position encodes scope" degrades into unenforced prose. The clearest case
 * is inline text formatting: Bold acts on a text range inside the selected node, so its `level` is
 * `selection`, while its `keyScope` is `caret` — which is what makes the chord live only when a
 * caret exists. There is deliberately no `range` level; a fifth level would demand a fifth region
 * and there is none.
 *
 * {@link PLACEMENT_MATRIX} is the normative table: each placement declares the set of levels it
 * admits. Mixed regions are mixed IN THE TABLE, never by prose exemption — the status bar is three
 * separate single-level placements, not one "mixed" one. `scripts/check-command-levels.ts`
 * validates every registered command's `menus` against this table, and `createCommandRegistry`
 * applies the same check at registration so a violation cannot reach a running app either.
 *
 * Panel placements (the two rail groups, the navigator dock body, the bottom dock, the inspector
 * dock) are part of the same matrix in `studio-ui-guidelines.md` §12 and live here too, in
 * {@link PANEL_PLACEMENT_MATRIX}: `registerPanel()` (`panels/panel-registry.ts`) now exists, so a
 * Panel record declares a `level` for the same reason a Command does and is checked the same way.
 * The two tables are separate because their placement VOCABULARIES are disjoint — a command is
 * never "in the rail's upper group", and a panel is never "in the block action bar".
