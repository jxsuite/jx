/**
 * Reference.ts — the registry, projected into the two generated documentation pages.
 *
 * Plan §12 P3 lists `docs/studio/interface/shortcuts.md` and a new
 * `docs/studio/interface/commands.md` as **generated from the registry at build time**, which is
 * the last of §5.5's seven derivations: with the chrome, the keymap, the palette, the menus and the
 * automation surface all rendering the same records, a hand-maintained shortcut sheet is the only
 * place left for the app's keyboard and its documentation to disagree.
 *
 * This module is the projection, not the generator. It takes a command set — `appCommandSet()`, the
 * one bare-Bun-importable export the three CI checks already load — and returns ROWS plus the
 * markdown table each page's body is made of. `scripts/docs/generate-reference.ts` supplies the
 * frontmatter, the prose and the file write; keeping the two apart is what lets the projection be
 * tested in this package, next to the records it reads, without a docs harness.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and sorted deterministically: a generated page that reorders itself
 * between runs is a CI diff nobody can review.
