 * Defaults.ts — the first real command records.
 *
 * These are not examples. Each one is a capability Studio already has, written out in the form
 * every surface will read it from, with the implementation taken by injection ({@link CommandDeps})
 * so this module imports no state and can be loaded by a CI check in a bare Bun process. Next wave
 * the bootstrap passes the real functions; nothing about the records changes.
 *
 * The one value import is `isSpliceablePath` — a four-token predicate over a path array, from the
 * module that also enforces it inside the mutators. An enablement predicate and the mutator it
 * guards disagreeing about which paths are editable is exactly how a Delete comes to be offered on
 * a selection it corrupts, so the two read the same function rather than the same sentence.
 *
 * Two of them exist to settle arguments the current code has with itself:
 *
 * - `document.close` is ⌘W. Today `editor/shortcuts.ts:192` refuses to close the last tab while
 *   `panels/tab-strip.ts:182`'s × closes it happily. Here the chord and the × button are the same
 *   record, so they cannot disagree again.
 * - `selection.duplicate` is "duplicate node", implemented four times today. Its `requires` string is
 *   what the block action bar's tooltip, the palette's grey subtitle and the agent's refusal all
 *   print — one sentence, three consumers.
 *
 * The primary Command Bar cluster is capped at five by `scripts/check-chrome-budget.ts`; four are
 * spent here (Save, Undo, Redo, Open in Browser) exactly as plan §3.2 region ① specifies.
