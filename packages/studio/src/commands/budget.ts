/**
 * Budget.ts — chrome is earned by frequency and capped by a build check.
 *
 * The chrome budget, studio-ui-guidelines.md §12.2: at most five commands may declare `menus:
 * ["commandbar/primary"]`, and at most four tabs per dock. `scripts/check-chrome-budget.ts` fails
 * CI otherwise, which is what turns "we should keep the toolbar small" from a code-review opinion
 * into a build error.
 *
 * The cap is not arbitrary. The toolbar's own CSS already admits it is over budget — a container
 * query at 1140px strips every `.tb-label` rather than conceding there are too many controls — and
 * an unlabelled icon is a control the user has to hover to identify. A hard number is what makes
 * "retire this control, keep its name and its chord" the cheap option.
 *
 * The dock/tab sets used to be a flat declaration — written out by hand from the shell redesign's
 * region table, because `registerPanel()` did not exist. It does now, so the two `rail/*` rows are
 * a QUERY over `railDeclarations()` ({@link dockTabs}) and adding a ninth rail panel fails this
 * check without anyone remembering to update a list. The two rows that remain declared are the two
 * docks whose tab sets this module cannot see from a bare Bun process: the Inspector's four come
 * from `commands/defaults.ts`'s `INSPECTOR_TABS` (a query in all but name), and the Bottom dock's
 * four are records in `panels/bottom-dock.ts`, which renders lit templates and therefore cannot be
 * imported here. `tests/bottom-dock.test.ts` asserts the declared row and the registered set are
 * the same four titles, so the copy cannot drift — the same bargain `tests/right-panel.test.ts`
 * strikes for the Inspector. Both become real queries the day `scripts/check-chrome-budget.ts`
 * joins them the way it already joins the rail.

 * (so `view.setBottomTab`'s enum can be read in a bare Bun process) and the four RECORDS live in
