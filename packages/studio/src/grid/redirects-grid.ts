/**
 * Redirects as a {@link GridSource} — the editor §11.4 asks for, over the table the grid already
 * is.
 *
 * `project.json`'s `redirects` map is tabular, so it does not need a bespoke editor: it needs the
 * one Studio already has. Columns, inline editing, add/delete rows, undo, the dirty dot, ⌘S,
 * find-and-replace, saved views and CSV export all arrive with the contract. What this module adds
 * is the three things a redirect table needs and a spreadsheet cannot know — that a chain costs a
 * round trip, that a loop is a broken page, and that a rule shadowed by a real route is dead config
 * — and it says each one as a **Problem naming the rule** (studio.md §16) rather than a toast that
 * disappears before the author has read the path it printed.
 *
 * **Every write goes through the one door.** Rows commit with {@link commitProjectConfig}, so a
 * redirect edit is a transaction on the `project.json` document with the same undo, the same
 * serialisation and the same refusal-with-a-Problem as every other configuration write (P6.1). This
 * module never touches `platform.writeFile`.
 *
 * **Row keys are positions.** A redirect's identity in `project.json` IS its source string, and the
 * source is the cell an author most often edits — so keying rows by it would turn every rename into
 * a delete plus an insert and lose the row's pending edits. Positions survive a rename; an insert
 * or a delete is structural and makes the controller reload, which re-keys everything.
