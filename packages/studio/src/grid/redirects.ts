/**
 * Redirect rules — the model, the three validations, and the two import formats.
 *
 * Pure: no platform, no DOM, no project state. `redirects-grid.ts` is what puts this in front of an
 * author; everything decidable about a redirect is decided here, where it can be tested with a
 * literal array instead of a project.
 *
 * **Why three validations and not a lint pass.** `project.json`'s `redirects` map is the one part
 * of a Jx project that is invisible in the thing it configures: nothing in the site renders it, and
 * a rule that is wrong looks exactly like a rule that is right (specs/site-architecture.md §11.4
 * asks for precisely these three). Each has a different cost and a different fix:
 *
 * - **Chain** — `/a → /b` where `/b` is itself a rule. The visitor pays a second round trip, and
 *   every hop is separately cacheable, so the last one to be corrected wins for a while. Fix: point
 *   the first rule at the final destination.
 * - **Loop** — a cycle. The page is unreachable. This is the only one filed as an error.
 * - **Shadow** — the project has a real route the rule's source covers. On a host that serves static
 *   assets before consulting `_redirects` (Netlify, Cloudflare Pages) the page wins and the rule is
 *   dead config; in `dist/` the compiler's own meta-refresh file overwrites the page and warns
 *   (site-architecture.md §11.1). Two hosts, two answers, and neither is what the author intended
 *   by writing both.
 *
 * **What is deliberately NOT decided.** A destination containing `:param` or `*` is not followed:
 * its concrete target depends on the request, so calling it a chain would be a guess. Nothing is
 * reported about it either way — see {@link validateRedirects}.
