/**
 * Grid view state — column layout, filter, sort, grouping — and the NAMED views that snapshot it.
 *
 * One store, not two. Column widths and order have persisted per grid id in `localStorage` since
 * the grid shipped; a saved view is the same record with three more facets and a name, written to
 * the same key. The alternative — a second `jx-grid-views:` store beside this one — is how a grid
 * ends up with a column order that a view cannot capture and a view that a resize does not update,
 * which is the class of bug saved views (site-architecture.md §7.2) must avoid by construction.
 *
 * **The working layout is the truth; a view is a copy of it.** Every control writes the working
 * layout (`saveGridLayout`), so a grid remembers how you left it whether or not you ever name a
 * view. {@link saveViewAs} copies the working layout under a name; {@link applySavedView} copies it
 * back and records which name is applied. That is why {@link activeViewModified} can answer
 * honestly — the applied name is a bookmark, not a mode, and a resize after applying one leaves the
 * two legitimately different rather than silently rewriting the view.
 *
 * **Per collection, for free.** The key is the grid id, and a grid id IS
 * `makeGridTabId({kind:"collection", name})` for a collection, the file path for a CSV, and
 * `grid://redirects` for the redirect table. Nothing here knows what a collection is.
 *
 * Pure besides the storage read/write. {@link applyGridLayout} returns a new column-def array with
 * saved widths applied, hidden fields withheld, and saved order first (columns unknown to the saved
 * layout keep their relative position at the end; saved fields that no longer exist are ignored —
 * schemas drift).
