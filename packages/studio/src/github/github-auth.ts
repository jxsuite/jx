/**
 * GitHub sign-in for Jx Studio: the desktop's loopback redirect, and the browser's device flow.
 *
 * **Which flow runs depends on what the build has, not on preference.** A desktop launcher exposes
 * `githubAuth` on `globalThis.__jxPlatform`, backed by an RFC 8252 loopback redirect with PKCE —
 * the user signs in on GitHub's own page in their own browser, the authorization code comes back to
 * a loopback server, and the token is stored in the app's config folder at `0600`. A page in a
 * browser has no loopback server to redirect to, so it keeps the Device Flow below.
 *
 * The Device Flow needs no server-side redirect endpoint, which is exactly why it was chosen here
 * and exactly why it is the wrong tool for a desktop app: RFC 8628 designed it for devices that
 * cannot show a browser or take typed input, and it costs the user a code copied between windows.
 *
 * **This flow fails, and until now it failed silently.** `https://github.com/login/device/code`
 * sends no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, so a browser cannot call it: in Studio-in-a-browser the
 * very first request rejects with a bare `TypeError`. That rejection used to become a thrown
 * `Error` out of {@link authenticateGithub}, into `void createGithubRepository(…)` in
 * `panels/git-panel.ts`, and from there into an unhandled promise rejection — the user clicked
 * "Create GitHub repository" and the app did nothing at all, forever, with no message anywhere.
 *
 * Three failures now reach a surface, each as the kind of record §16 says it is:
 *
 * - **Unreachable** (CORS, offline, DNS) → a **Problem**, because it must be fixed and the fix is not
 *   in this dialog, carrying `git.signInToGithub` as its Retry;
 * - **Refused by GitHub** (an HTTP error, `access_denied`, `expired_token`) → a **toast**, because
 *   the state is now correct and there is nothing to fix — the user declined, or waited too long;
 * - **A poll that keeps failing** → a Problem after {@link MAX_POLL_FAILURES} consecutive rejections,
 *   rather than the previous empty catch that re-armed the timer forever. A dialog that says
 *   "Waiting for authorization…" against a network that will never answer is the exact dishonesty
 *   the feedback system exists to end.
 *
 * **What it cannot tell you.** A cross-origin block and an unplugged cable are the same `TypeError`
 * here — the browser withholds the reason on purpose — so the detail names both rather than
 * guessing between them.
 *
 * **The waiting room is a document.** `surfaces/github-auth.json` draws the code, the link and the
 * wait, over the kit's `jx-dialog`; this module keeps the client id, the poll loop, its failure
 * budget and every report above. The dialog it replaced was an `<sp-dialog-wrapper>` whose one
 * `@cancel`/`@close` handler both stopped the loop and resolved the promise, so "the reader
 * dismissed this" and "GitHub answered" were the same code path — and the promise could be resolved
 * a second time with `null` by the close that a successful sign-in itself provokes. Answering and
 * closing are two steps now, in that order.
 *
 * The token is returned to callers and never rendered. In a browser it is stored in `localStorage`;
 * on the desktop it is in the launcher's `0600` credential store and this module holds it only in
 * memory for the session. `settings/preferences-accounts.ts` lists it as _stored or not_ and is the
 * only place it can be revoked (`studio.md` §15 rule 1).
