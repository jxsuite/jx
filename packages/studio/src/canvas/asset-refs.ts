/**
 * Asset references, resolved for the canvas — the half that asks the running editor.
 *
 * The resolution math itself is {@link file://./asset-resolve.ts}, which is pure and which the
 * canvas iframe imports. This module is everything that has to look something up: the open
 * project's content sections and locales, the active tab, the registered platform's declarations.
 *
 * The split is by REALM. The iframe bundle is deliberately dependency-light, and reaching
 * `projectState` or `getPlatform()` from it drags the whole editor shell in behind it — which is
 * what `check-studio-dist` caught the first time these lived in one file.
