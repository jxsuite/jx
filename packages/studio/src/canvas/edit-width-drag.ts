/**
 * Apply a width to a live Edit column — the drag's only DOM writer.
 *
 * **Bare style writes, and never `renderPane`.** A full canvas render per pointermove would rebuild
 * the iframe DOM, break the handle's own pointer capture along with it, and be far too slow to drag
 * against — which is why this writes `session.ui.activeMedia` directly rather than going through
 * `canvas.setBreakpoint`, whose `run` ends in a `repaint`. (It is NOT because a re-render would
 * destroy an inline-edit session: pressing the handle already ended that, through the capture-phase
 * `commitActiveEditSession` in `studio.ts`. The reason is cost and capture, not the caret.)
 *
 * The direct write is safe because `activeMedia` is deliberately absent from
 * `installPaneRenderEffects`'s dependency list, so it repaints the Context bar, the overlays and
 * the Inspector — none of which owns the column — and schedules no canvas pass at all.
 *
 * **{@link applyEditZoom} is called only when there IS a zoom**, and that is a correctness fix, not
 * a micro-optimisation. It ends in `renderOnly("overlays")`, which is a full lit render of the
 * block action bar — and that render's first act is to tear down the drag handle's pragmatic-dnd
 * registration (`panels/block-action-bar.ts`, which already routes AROUND itself on scroll for
 * exactly this reason). At `editZoom === 1` there is nothing for it to do anyway: the column is
 * `width: 100%` under a `max-width` and the iframe is `width: 100%` under the column, so the CSS
 * write above has already reflowed the frame. `settle()` re-anchors once, on release.
 *
 * The breakpoint is derived from the MEASURED width rather than the requested one: the column is
 * `width: 100%` under a `max-width`, so a pane narrower than the request renders narrower than it,
 * and a readout computed from the request would name a band the page is not in.
