 * + reactivity + the pure path-mapping helpers) so the iframe bundle is small.

 * The design/edit-mode canvas CSS, ported from the parent editor stylesheet (index.html) with
 * iframe-safe fallbacks — the parent theme variables (--fg-dim/--radius/--accent) don't exist in
 * the iframe document. The placeholder CLASSES are stamped by prepareForEditMode (parent-side
 * resolution + surgical subtree renders), so preview mode never matches these rules — but the sheet
 * is still removed there (belt and braces). The `[data-jx-active-block]` hint marks the caret's
 * empty paragraph (e.g. right after an Enter split) and advertises the slash menu.
 *
 * `.empty-text-placeholder` is gated on emptiness IN THE DOM because a CLASS cannot tell the truth
 * about a block the author is typing in. The class is stamped from the document, and the first
 * thing typed into an empty block reaches the DOM natively — the model learns of it a commit tick
 * later, and that patch comes back as an ECHO, which `applyIframePatch` deliberately does not
 * re-render (it would destroy the caret). So the class outlived its own meaning, and "Click here to
 * add text..." sat beside the text you had just typed until the next full render. The class now
 * selects WHICH affordance; the DOM answers whether the block is empty.
 *
 * "Empty" is `:empty` OR a lone `<br>`, because emptying a block by editing does not leave it
 * `:empty`: the engine drops in a filler `<br>` to keep the line visible (Chrome 151, verified —
 * `execCommand("delete")` over a `<p>`'s whole content leaves `<p><br></p>`). Without that arm the
 * affordance would go dark exactly when the block became empty again.
 *
 * `:not([data-jx-active-block])` keeps the slash hint winning on an empty block that HAS the caret:
 * both rules match the same element, and the emptiness test broke the specificity tie that used to
 * decide it by source order.

/* The UA rule a de-popovered element lost, re-supplied at UA-EQUIVALENT PRECEDENCE.

   The cascade layer is the mechanism and it is the whole point. An unlayered author declaration
   beats a layered one whatever its specificity, and every declaration applyStyle emits is an
   unlayered rule in an adopted sheet. That is exactly how author origin beats UA origin on the
   shipped page, so the canvas reproduces the real cascade rather than an approximation of it.

   This used to read "a base declaration is written as an INLINE style", which was true and is the
   reason the guarantee survived the move: inline beat layered harder still, and unlayered beats it
   by the same rule one step down. Jx emits no layer of its own, which is what keeps that true.

   Deliberately NOT forced with a priority flag. A popover whose base rule sets display is laid out
   on every page whether open or not; that is a real defect, @jxsuite/schema/overlays reports it as
   base-display, and the canvas's job is to SHOW it, not to hide it behind a stronger rule. */

/* SHOWN IN PLACE, and the position declaration is what makes that true.

   Dropping the popover attribute drops the UA rule that made the panel fixed, so a panel that never
   set position itself — every one in the fleet — lands in normal flow at its document position,
   contributes to #jx-canvas-root's scrollHeight, and the host grows the artboard to fit it. That is
   the whole geometry fix, and it is why an open panel is reachable at all.

   The two alignment declarations are the other half, and they were found by measuring rather than
   by reasoning. Every drawer in the fleet is declared inside its header's flex row, so in flow it
   becomes a FLEX ITEM: align-items:center on the row centres a 904px panel on a 64px header and
   half of it sits above the artboard at a negative offset, where it contributes nothing to the
   scrollable overflow the host measures. Pinned to the start and refused any flex sizing, the same
   panel hangs down from its own position and the artboard grows by its full height.

   Forced, because a panel that DOES set position: fixed would otherwise keep it and be laid out
   against the frame's own viewport — which in an editable mode is the document's full height, so a
   drawer pinned with inset: 0 lands halfway down a long page and a short component frame clips it.
   This is a presentation override for an editing affordance, the same kind as the layout-region
   dimming above, and it is NOT the same move as forcing display: that would hide a real defect in
   the document (base-display), while this hides nothing — Preview renders the panel natively, top
   layer and all. */
