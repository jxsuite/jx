/*
 * There is no `initCanvasUtils`, and no `_ctx`.
 *
 * It injected three functions — `getCanvasMode`, `getZoom`, `setZoomDirect` — and all three were
 * spelled `activeTab.value`, which is the FOCUSED pane's tab. Every geometry function here already
 * takes a `CanvasSurface`, so the pan/zoom offsets and the pan-zoom wrap moved onto it while the
 * SCALE stayed behind the injection, and the two disagreed in four visible ways:
 *
 *   1 · the unfocused pane drew at the focused tab's scale — `scale(1)` for a document at 2×;
 *   2 · the side pane's `+` zoomed the PRIMARY's document, by a factor computed from the side's
 *       own zoom (`b.zoom * 1.2` written to `a`);
 *   3 · `getFit()` keyed on `activeTab`, so the unfocused pod reported the focused pane's fit;
 *   4 · the side pane entering Design ran `fitOnCanvasEntry` → `setZoomDirect(0.163)` and the
 *       PRIMARY snapped to 16%, because the other pane had fitted itself.
 *
 * `scripts/check-pane-singletons.ts` could not see any of it: it bans `view.<field>` by name and
 * the zoom was never on `view`. The rule it enforces is now the general one — per-stage state is
 * reached through a surface — and this module reads `activeTab` in exactly one place, the command
 * verbs, where "the active pane" is the whole meaning of the request.

 * with no bridge changes.
 *
 * `renderWidth` is measured live from `.content-edit-column` (already `min(baseWidth, available)`
 * via normal block layout) — the nominal `$media["--"]` width would overflow a narrow studio
 * window.
 *
 * HARD INVARIANT: never trigger a canvas re-render from here (`renderCanvas`/`mountIframeCanvas`) —
