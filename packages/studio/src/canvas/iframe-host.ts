 * single number for a multi-pane fan-out is not a parameter needing a better value — it is the bug.
 * Whichever pane had rendered more recently held the higher `renderedGen`, and `iframe-entry.ts`
 * dropped the patch there in silence, leaving a wrong picture on screen with `__jxCanvasPerf`
 * reporting a clean surgical apply. Each host's own generation is resolved inside the loop
 * instead.
 *
 * `host` is deliberately not a pane-scoped parameter name (see `PANE_PARAM_NAMES`), and the body
 * reads no focus: `panelHostingCanvas` resolves the stage from the host's own element.

 * re-resolved and re-serialized a document that had been prepared moments earlier, and evicted pane
 * B's in turn. Three preparations for three artboards — the fan-out this cache exists to remove,

 * Within a generation the key is document IDENTITY, because git-diff mounts two different documents
 * under one generation and each gets its own entry. `tabId` rides along because `editableTags` is

 * THAT — the document path, the layout toggle, the preview params and the mode. A mismatch in
 * either re-prepares rather than reusing. `tabId` alone would not do: an override render nulls it,

 * The iframe is a real viewport, so its CSS width is the layout viewport `@media` evaluates

 * (edit-mode / git-diff / full-width panels) falls back to `100%`. The iframe stays FIXED-HEIGHT —
 * content scrolls inside it like a real device viewport; narrowing the width does not auto-grow
 * it.
 *
 * `tabId` is the identity of the tab whose document this render shows (null for override docs like
 * git-diff, whose iframes must never route doc mutations anywhere). It is recorded against `gen`
 * and adopted into `host.tabId` only when the iframe acks the render — see

 *
 * `viewTab` is a DIFFERENT question and that is why it is a second parameter: `tabId` asks "where
 * do this frame's mutations go", `viewTab` asks "whose document path, layout toggle, preview params
 * and canvas mode resolve it". They diverge for exactly the override case — a git-diff render has
 * no mutation target but is still a view OF the tab whose diff it is, and its `docBase` and edit
 * transform must come from that tab. The default derives it from the element, the way
 * `paneOfContainer` does everywhere else stage content is handed a host and nothing else; the one
 * production caller (`canvas-render.ts`) passes `tabOfPane(surface.paneId)` explicitly, because it
 * has already resolved it to pick the document.
 *
 * `modeOverride` is the third question in the same family, and it exists because `viewTab` cannot
 * answer it: a lens draws the source pane's document in a mode that is never written onto that tab,
 * so resolving the mode from `viewTab` gave a Diff lens's artboards the SOURCE pane's mode. See
 * {@link resolveCanvasDocument}. Null derives it from `viewTab` as before.
