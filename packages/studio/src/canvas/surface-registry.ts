/**
 * The surface REGISTRY — one stage record per pane, and nothing that knows what a pane contains.
 *
 * A pane is the unit of split, focus and zoom (§4.1), so it is also the unit of RENDER. The panels
 * a pass mounted, the host element they mounted into, the mode that pass was drawn in and the full
 * render a failed patch escalates to are all facts about ONE pane; they were app-level singletons
 * only because the shell had a single stage.
 *
 * They could not stay that way. `classifyOps` gated a patch on `canvasPanels.every(p => p.ready)`
 * and on one `getCanvasMode()`, and `escalateToFullRender` scheduled the one global render — so the
 * moment a second stage exists, an edit typed into one pane would be refused because the OTHER
 * pane's canvas was still mounting, and every escalation would re-render both. That is a
 * correctness bug, not a performance one, which is why this lands before the second host rather
 * than with it.
 *
 * A surface is addressed by pane id and nothing else. `panels/pane-grid.ts` builds a cell per pane
 * and registers its stage as it goes.
 *
 * **Split from `canvas-surface.ts` for one reason: the WORKSPACE.** The helpers that answer "which
 * tab is this pane showing" need `workspace/workspace.ts`, and `workspace.ts` needs
 * `services/monaco-buffer.ts` — which in turn has to enumerate every stage's source buffer, because
 * a close gate that asked only "the" Monaco would miss whichever pane it was not holding. That is a
 * cycle. The store of records has no opinion about tabs, so it is the half that comes out.
