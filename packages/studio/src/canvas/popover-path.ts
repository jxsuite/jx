 * Which popover a document path belongs to — the pure half of the open-on-selection rule.
 *
 * Separate from `popover-state.ts` because of who needs it. The command record in `canvas-utils.ts`
 * has to answer "is there a popover here?" for its `enablement`, and `popover-state.ts` reaches
 * `iframe-host.ts`, which reaches `canvas-utils.ts` — so importing the whole rule from the command
 * file would close a cycle. Nothing here touches a frame, a channel or the DOM, which is also what
 * makes it the easy half to test.

 * Whether the focused document has any popover — what the command's `enablement` asks.

 * A fact about the DOCUMENT, not about the selection. Gating on the selection looked tighter and
 * was wrong: the palette, the assistant and a screenshot step all name a popover by path, and an
 * enablement predicate cannot see the arguments, so it would have refused every one of them before
 * the path was read. The specific refusal — "that path is not a popover" — belongs to the run,
 * where the argument exists.
 *
 * Reading the focused tab is correct here and only here: enablement describes what would happen if
 * you pressed Enter now, and that is the pane you are in. The command's `run` resolves its tab
 * through `contextTab` instead, so a `pane` argument still decides the write. That split is why
 * this lives here rather than in `canvas-utils.ts`, whose stage-geometry functions must never read
 * the focused tab (`check-pane-singletons.ts` enforces it).
