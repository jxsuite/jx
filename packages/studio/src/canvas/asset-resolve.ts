/**
 * Asset references, resolved for the canvas — the PURE half.
 *
 * Separate from `asset-refs.ts` for one reason, and it is a hard one: this module runs **inside the
 * canvas iframe**, which is a deliberately dependency-light bundle. `asset-refs.ts` reaches the
 * open project, the active tab and the registered platform, and importing any of that from the
 * iframe drags the entire editor shell in behind it. The build gate caught exactly that.
 *
 * So the split is by REALM, not by taste: everything here is a pure function of its arguments, and
 * everything that has to ask the running editor a question lives next door.
 *
 * A document names media in one of two shapes, and neither is a URL the canvas can use as written.
 *
 * A content entry references media relative to ITSELF — `![](./images/hero.png)` — so the file
 * reads correctly in a plain markdown editor and so collections sourced outside the project root
 * still reach their media (specs/site-architecture.md §9.3). On the built site the collection
 * loader rewrites those refs onto the content type's asset mount,
 * `/content/<type>/images/hero.png`. Studio opens an entry as a STANDALONE document, so that loader
 * never runs.
 *
 * A page references media by SITE URL — `/hero.jpg` — which is a file the project tree calls
 * `public/hero.jpg`. That works wherever the canvas is hosted by something that serves the site's
 * own URL space, which is what the dev server and the desktop loopback both are.
 *
 * {@link AssetContext} is the host's answer to "which of those two do you serve", and
 * {@link resolveAssetRef} is the whole of the resolution:
 *
 * - `"site"` — the origin already answers site URLs, so only the content-mount mapping is missing.
 *   This is what desktop and `jx dev` have always done, and the default when a host says nothing.
 * - `"repo"` — nothing answers a site URL, and the host serves PROJECT PATHS under a base instead.
 *   Every reference resolves to the file it names and is rebased onto that base. The mount detour
 *   disappears: a content entry's `./images/hero.png` is already `content/posts/images/hero.png`, a
 *   real path the host can serve.
 *
 * The SOURCE document is never touched in either case: the authored ref is what gets serialized
 * back to disk, and the properties panel shows the author what they wrote.
 *
 * One deliberate divergence from the content loader: it declines to rewrite a ref whose target does
 * not exist (`existsSync`), leaving an unresolvable path alone rather than changing its meaning.
 * The browser has no filesystem, so this resolves optimistically. A missing file is broken either
 * way; pointing at the URL the built site would have attempted is the more informative failure.
