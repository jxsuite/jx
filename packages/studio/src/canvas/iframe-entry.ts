  // Parent-originated drag (palette / layers / ⠿ handle) crosses onto the canvas the parent stops
  // Seeing dragover — it can't forward dragMove, and cross-origin nothing preventDefaults here,
  // Giving the "not allowed" cursor and a dead drop. So handle the native stream directly: while a
  // Parent session is live (dragSrc set), accept the drag, post dragOver previews from OUR
  // ClientX/y (already iframe-local — no rect conversion), and on drop post the authoritative
  // DropResult. The cursor rides on dragOver so the parent can keep its ghost tracking (it has no
  // Pointer stream of its own while the drag is over this frame).
  //
  // A native stream arriving with NO session yet (dragSrc null) is a parent drag that crossed onto
  // The canvas before the parent could bind a host (it never sees a cursor inside the iframe rect) —
  // Post nativeDragEnter so the bridge binds the session here. Throttled: dragover fires

  // Otherwise spam the channel forever.
