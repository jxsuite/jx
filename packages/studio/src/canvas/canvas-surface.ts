/**
 * Canvas surfaces — one stage per pane, asked about the pane it belongs to.
 *
 * A pane is the unit of split, focus and zoom (§4.1), so it is also the unit of RENDER. The panels
 * a pass mounted, the host element they mounted into, the mode that pass was drawn in and the full
 * render a failed patch escalates to are all facts about ONE pane; they were app-level singletons
 * only because the shell had a single stage.
 *
 * The RECORDS live in `./surface-registry`, which knows nothing about tabs (see the note there on
 * the cycle that forced the split). Everything here composes a surface with the workspace: which
 * tab a pane is showing, which stage is showing a tab, which pane mounted an artboard.

 * repaints the lens because it is the same reactive read.
 *
 * A COMPANION pane owns its tabs normally and takes no hop — the derivation only decides which of
 * its own tabs is on screen.
 *
 * The distinction this draws is not a new one in the render path: `mountIframeCanvas(gen, doc,
 * canvasEl, widthPx, tabId, viewTab)` has separated "where do this frame's mutations go" from
 * "whose document path, layout toggle and canvas mode resolve it" since the git-diff override. A
