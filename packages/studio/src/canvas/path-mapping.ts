 *
 * The runtime fires `onNodeCreated(el, renderPath, def, state)` for every node. The render path is
 * not always the document path: layout-wrapped pages shift page content under a layout prefix, and
 * `prepareForEditMode` renders mapped arrays (`$prototype: Array`) as a `repeater-perimeter` whose
 * single child hop must be collapsed back to a `map` segment. {@link classifyRenderNode} resolves a
 * render path to either a document path or a "layout" marker; {@link serializeJxPath} encodes the
 * result for the `data-jx-path` attribute.
