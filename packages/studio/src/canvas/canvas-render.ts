 * Drop the source-mode Monaco, its model, and the debounced work armed over it.

 * `getValue()` off the editor it closes over, a disposed Monaco answers the empty string, and for a
 * format-backed document the callback then runs `parseSourceForPath(path, "")` and assigns the
 * result — **the page's body replaced with an empty parse, 600ms after the user left Code view,
 * with the tab marked dirty so the next ⌘S writes it to disk.** For a `.json` tab the same path
 * threw inside `JSON.parse("")` and was swallowed by the catch, which is luck rather than design
 * and is why only one of the two shapes was ever reported.
 *
 * One function, so there is one place for the teardown to be and no fourth site can omit it.
 *
 * **And it commits before it cancels.** Cancelling alone traded a dead buffer's `""` for the user's
 * last 600ms of typing, which is still lost work and is now silent: `doc.dirty` stays `false`, so
 * nothing says the edit went missing. {@link commitBufferWrites} runs the armed parse WHILE the
 * model is still attached — `getValue()` is read before its first `await` — and only then drops
 * what is left, so leaving Code view saves the edit instead of choosing which way to discard it.
 *
 * **And the parse is allowed not to land, which is the third way out.** Unparseable source
 * deliberately keeps the buffer rather than resyncing over a half-typed heading — the right call
 * while the surface is standing, and a deletion the moment it is not, because the next two lines
 * detach the model and the text existed nowhere else. `commitBufferWrites` says so; it cannot say
 * it synchronously, because the parse runs through the format host, so the answer arrives with the
 * promise. Refusing the teardown instead is not available to any of the three callers: they are a
 * pane reset, a mode transition and a model-URI swap, each of which has already taken the container
 * or the URI this editor needs, and a Monaco kept alive over either is unreachable rather than

 * canvas bridge, so the palette, the keyboard, the AI and `__jxAutomation` could not do the one
