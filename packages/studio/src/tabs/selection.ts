/**
 * The selection SET — one vocabulary for `session.selection`, now that it is `JxPath[]` (§6.7).
 *
 * ## The invariant this module exists to hold
 *
 * **A selection of one behaves exactly as a selection did before it was a list.** Every surface
 * that addresses a single node — the Inspector's three tabs, the block action bar, the status bar,
 * the canvas overlay box, the context menu — reads {@link primarySelection} and nothing else. When
 * `length === 1` that function returns the sole path, so those surfaces receive byte-identically
 * what `session.selection` used to hand them. Nothing downstream of `primarySelection` can tell the
 * difference, and that is what makes the widening shippable: the multi cases are additions beside
 * the single case, never a rewrite of it.
 *
 * The corollary is a rule about writes: **replace the array, never mutate it in place.** Several
 * render effects track the selection with a bare `void tab.session.selection` read, which
 * subscribes to the property and not to the array's indices; an in-place `push` would move the
 * selection without repainting the panel that draws it. Every helper here returns a NEW array.
 *
 * ## Ordering, and why two ends of the list have names
 *
 * The list is kept in the order the user built it.
 *
 * - {@link selectionAnchor} is `selection[0]` — where a shift-range extends FROM. It survives every
 *   range extension, so shift-clicking A then D then B gives A..D then A..B, which is what every
 *   list in every file manager does.
 * - {@link primarySelection} is the LAST element — the most recently added path, and therefore the
 *   one the user just pointed at. Single-target surfaces address it.
 *
 * ## Structural batches
 *
 * A multi-node structural edit is one decision and must be one undo step, which `transactDoc`
 * already gives for free — everything mutated inside one call is one history entry. What it does
 * NOT give is index safety: removing `children/0` renumbers `children/1`, so a naive loop over the
 * selection deletes the wrong nodes. {@link structuralBatch} answers that once — descendants
 * dropped, then descending document order, so every splice happens below coordinates nothing later
 * in the batch depends on.
 *
 * It also answers a second question the single-path world never had to ask: whether a selected path
 * is a splice coordinate AT ALL. The Outline gives the document element, a repeater's map template
 * and a `$switch` case rows of their own, and any of them can be ctrl-clicked into a selection
 * beside an ordinary element. {@link isSpliceablePath} is the test, and it is the one thing
 * standing between a mixed selection and a half-applied, unrecorded delete.
