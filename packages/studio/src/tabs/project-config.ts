/**
 * The project configuration document — `project.json` under the transaction log.
 *
 * `project.json` is the file that defines the project, and until now it was the one file Studio
 * edited with no document behind it. Twenty-nine call sites across eight modules each reached for
 * `platform.writeFile("project.json", …)` (directly or through `updateSiteConfig`), in two
 * different serialisations, with no history and no dirty flag — and twenty-one of them dropped a
 * rejected write on the floor, leaving the form showing a value that was never persisted.
 *
 * This module is the one door. Every configuration write is now a TRANSACTION on a real {@link Tab}
 * whose `documentPath` is `project.json`, which is what buys undo, the dirty flag and ⌘S from the
 * machinery every other document already uses (`tabs/transact.ts`). `tab.ts`'s `inferModes` has
 * always answered `["stylebook", "source"]` for this path, so the tab's editor kind is `config`
 * (see `editorKindForMode`) with no new wiring.
 *
 * **The document of record.** When the author has `project.json` open in the workspace, THAT tab is
 * the configuration document: the settings surfaces and the open tab edit one object, so neither
 * can silently clobber the other. When it is not open the module keeps a document of its own, with
 * the same log, and hands over the moment a tab appears. One rule, stated once:
 * `projectState.projectConfig` is always `toRaw(document.doc.document)`.
 *
 * **One object, and a handover that cannot lose an edit.** That rule is restored at the moment a
 * tab is adopted, and adoption is reached lazily — from inside a commit. So a `project.json` tab
 * opened from the Files tree (`files/files.ts` parses the file itself) arrives holding a SECOND
 * configuration object, and until the next commit the settings surfaces are still rendering, and
 * mutating in place, the one they were loaded with. {@link commitProjectConfig} therefore reads the
 * live configuration BEFORE it binds and commits THAT object's content, adopting it into the
 * document; the alternative — letting the tab's parse win because it happened to bind last —
 * dropped the first settings edit after the tab was opened, wrote the drop to disk, and reported
 * success. When the document holds unsaved authoring of its own the two cannot be reconciled, and
 * §16 gets a Problem instead of a silent winner. {@link adoptProjectConfig} is the same handover
 * from the other side: a config that reached disk without passing through here (the assistant's
 * `write_file`) is put INTO the document rather than left beside it as a rival.
 *
 * **One serialisation.** {@link serializeProjectConfig} is `files/json-layout.ts`'s serializer over
 * the layout the file was read in — byte-for-byte what `files/serialize-document.ts`'s native-JSON
 * branch writes, so a ⌘S on the open tab and a settings edit produce the same file. The predecessor
 * had `null, 2` in `site-context.ts` and `"\t"` in both `settings/contributed-section.ts` and
 * `settings/defs-editor.ts`, so a settings edit re-indented the entire file — every `project.json`
 * in this repository is on disk with two spaces. It was then `JSON.stringify(config, null, 2)`,
 * which agreed with the tab's save and disagreed with the formatter: a one-field edit re-laid every
 * short array in the file (issue 308).
 *
 * **A no-op edit writes nothing.** A form that re-commits the value it already holds — and every
 * one of these surfaces has such a path — used to rewrite the whole file. A commit now compares the
 * serialised result against what the file itself says and returns without a transaction, without a
 * write, and therefore with an empty diff.
 *
 * **A real edit is a one-line diff.** The file's layout — which objects sit on one line, where a
 * blank line falls — is read once per binding ({@link seedCommitted}) and every serialisation here
 * honours it, so what changes on disk is the field that changed.
 *
 * **Collaboration.** `project.json` is out of collab replication; the gate is in
 * `collab/collab-session.ts`'s `ensureCollab`, which is what would otherwise register the Yjs
 * history delegate over this tab.
