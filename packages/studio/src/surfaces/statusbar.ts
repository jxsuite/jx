/**
 * ⑫ The status bar — ambient state, in scope order, and nothing else.
 *
 * What this replaces: a bar built by `innerHTML` string concatenation with a three-character
 * escaper, carrying whatever the last of 78 `statusMessage()` calls had said, for three seconds.
 * Transient messages have left entirely for the toast host (`ui/layers.ts`) and the Problems list
 * (`services/notify.ts`); what remains here is state that is TRUE for as long as it is shown.
 *
 * **Three fixed fields, in the shell's own left-to-right level order** (plan §3.2 ⑫), so the bar
 * restates the containment model on every glance:
 *
 * ```text
 * PROJECT                        ‖ DOCUMENT                       ‖ SELECTION
 * name · branch ↑n↓n · problems  ‖ path · view · save state       ‖ count · style rule
 * ```
 *
 * The SELECTION field held an ancestor breadcrumb until region ⑥ landed. The trail is an ADDRESS,
 * not ambient state, and it now lives once — in the jump bar (`panels/jump-bar.ts`), which merged
 * it with the pane context bar's document-stack chain. What is left here is the count and the
 * Stylebook's rule, neither of which is a path.
 *
 * `statusbar/project`, `statusbar/document` and `statusbar/selection` are three placements the
 * level × placement matrix already declares, each admitting exactly one level — so the bar's
 * mixedness is structural rather than an exemption.
 *
 * **The effective view, not a mode string.** The bar used to print "Content Mode" from
 * `tab.doc.mode` while the Command Bar printed "Design" from `canvasMode` — two surfaces reading
 * two fields to answer one question. Both now read `registry.context()`, which is the same record
 * every `when` predicate reads, so they cannot disagree again.
 *
 * **Every interactive item is a command.** There are no click handlers in this file: an item names
 * a command id, and renders as a button only when the registry has that command and its `when`
 * holds. That is what lets an item that has no command yet — the peers count, whose `Collaborate:`
 * family lands with P4.8 — sit in the template today and start rendering the day it is registered,
 * with no edit here. The three readouts that are NOT buttons are marked: the view name (its control
 * is the pane context bar ⑦; a second mode picker in 24px would be the chrome duplication §2
 * principle 9 exists to prevent), the save wording once a document IS saved, and the stylebook
 * selector.
 *
 * The bar is the `statusbar` surface (`surfaces/statusbar.json`): this module is the projection —
 * three fields of items, each item a button with a command or a readout without — and the surface
 * draws it. The scope is reactive, so one effect recomputes the projection from the state the bar
 * renders; nothing repaints.
