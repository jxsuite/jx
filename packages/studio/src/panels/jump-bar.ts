/**
 * ⑥ The jump bar — the pane's address, and every place you can go from it.
 *
 * **The two half-breadcrumbs this replaces.** Studio grew two trails, neither of which could say
 * where you were:
 *
 * 1. `panels/pane-context.ts`'s `navTpl()` (the old `#tab-bar` breadcrumb, plan §3.2 ⑥ names it as
 *    `tab-bar.ts:129-185`) — a `Back` button plus one span per `session.documentStack` frame. It
 *    appeared ONLY while you were inside a sub-document, printed the frame's file basename (which
 *    is the SAME basename for a `$map` template, so it read `index.json › index.json`), and knew
 *    nothing about the project above it or the selection below it. It is deleted, and so is the
 *    stack it walked: nothing ever pushed a frame, so it could only ever draw its empty branch.
 * 2. `surfaces/statusbar.ts`'s selection field — a clickable ancestor trail, `selection.set` per
 *    crumb. It appeared ONLY while something was selected, and knew nothing about the document it
 *    was inside.
 *
 * Between them they never rendered at the same time as each other and never rendered the whole
 * address, so neither one was a place to look. **This bar is the whole chain**, always:
 *
 * ```text
 * ◈ Site › pages/blog/[slug].json › article › h1 ⌄
 *   project        file              selection ancestors
 * ```
 *
 * **The status bar keeps only what an address cannot say.** Plan §3.2 ⑫ and `studio.md` §16.2 give
 * the bar AMBIENT STATE, and an ancestor trail in a second place is exactly the duplication the
 * shell redesign exists to remove — three breadcrumbs would be worse than the two we started with.
 * So the trail moves here whole, and `statusbar/selection` keeps the two facts this bar cannot
 * state: HOW MANY things are selected (a count is not a path) and which Stylebook rule the Style
 * panel is editing (a selector is not a node).
 *
 * **Every interactive item is a command, resolved from the registry.** There is no click handler in
 * this file that names behaviour: a segment names a command id and its args, and the registry
 * supplies the title, the chord, the enablement and the run. Three ids carry the whole bar —
 * `project.openRecent`, `palette.openFiles` and `selection.set` — and this file declares none of
 * them. It did declare a fourth, `document.setStackLevel`, for the sub-document stack; the stack
 * had no way in and both are gone.
 *
 * **A segment whose command the registry does not have becomes a readout, it does not disappear.**
 * That is the one place this bar deliberately differs from the status bar, where an unavailable
 * item vanishes. An address with a hole in it is a lie about containment; a readout is merely a
 * step you cannot take.
 *
 * **This file is the FLOW; the markup is a document.** `surfaces/jump-bar.json` owns the bar's
 * structure, its ARIA and every value in its style, and `surfaces/jump-bar.ts` mounts one per pane
 * (studio-ui-guidelines.md §6, §9.3). What stays here is the part that is a decision: which pane
 * this bar is about, what its address is, which of its steps the registry can run, and what a
 * chevron opens — and the chevron opens the KIT MENU, `surfaces/menu.ts`, because a list of
 * commands is what that surface already is (§12.5).
