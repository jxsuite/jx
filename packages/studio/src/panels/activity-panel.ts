/**
 * Activity — where a long operation lives while it runs, and what it leaves behind (plan §7.3).
 *
 * What this replaces: `ui/progress-modal.ts` was **the only surface in Studio with a real error
 * view** — a red headline, the captured log in a `<pre>`, an explicit Close — and it had four call
 * sites, all package operations. It blocked the whole app, offered no cancel, and vanished
 * completely on success, so a `bun install` that hung had no exit and one that failed had a log you
 * could read exactly once. Every OTHER long operation — git clone, publish, media upload, site
 * import, project open — got a three-second grey line or nothing at all.
 *
 * An activity is a **record**, like a notification and a command:
 *
 * - It is **persistent** — a finished operation stays on the list, with its log, until the list is
 *   cleared, so "what did the import actually do?" is answerable after the fact;
 * - It is **inspectable** — the log is the same captured output the modal used to show, and it is
 *   attached to the entry rather than to a modal that is about to close;
 * - It can be **cancelled** — an operation that hands over a `cancel` callback gets a Cancel button
 *   on its row, which is the affordance a hung install has never had;
 * - And it **fails into Problems** — {@link ActivityHandle.fail} raises a `notify.error` carrying the
 *   log as its `detail`, so the failure outlives the run and carries a Retry command. That is
 *   §7.3's "the progress modal's error view is promoted into Problems", in one function.
 *
 * **Nothing here blocks.** `showProgressModal` still exists for the four dependency-install sites
 * §7.3 keeps blocking, and it is now a thin front end over {@link beginActivity} — so even the
 * blocking case leaves an inspectable entry behind, and closing the modal no longer loses it.
 *
 * `services/idle.ts` reads {@link activityIdleBlockers}: an open operation means the app is not
 * settled, which is the §13.6 S4 obligation every phase's checklist carries.
