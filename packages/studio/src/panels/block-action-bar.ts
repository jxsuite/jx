/**
 * Block action bar — the floating toolbar above the selected element.
 *
 * The bar is a RENDERING of the command registry (plan §3.2 region ⑩, §5.5): its verb cluster is
 * `registry.forPlacement("blockbar")`, sliced at {@link BLOCKBAR_MAX_ITEMS} with the remainder
 * behind a `⋮` overflow menu. Every button's accessible name is its record's `title` and its
 * tooltip carries `keymap.formatBinding(id)`, so no action is named twice.
 *
 * `studio-ui-guidelines.md` §8.6 is normative about the shape: **ONE shape.** The bar does not
 * rearrange itself when the author starts typing, and a control that cannot act is DISABLED, not
 * removed — a toolbar whose buttons move under the cursor is worse than one with a greyed button.
 * That is why the parent selector, the badge, the drag handle and every verb render unconditionally
 * and take their disabled state (and its one-sentence reason) from the record's own `enablement`.
 *
 * **The markup left this file.** The bar is `surfaces/block-action-bar.json`, a Jx document over
 * the UI kit (studio-ui-guidelines.md §1, §6, §9.3), mounted once by
 * `surfaces/block-action-bar.ts`; what stays here is every DECISION — which records are placed,
 * whether each can act, where the bar belongs against the selection rect, when it steps aside, and
 * what a press does. The toolbar role, the roving caret and the ←/→/Home/End contract are
 * `jx-action-group`'s, so the hand-written `[data-toolbar-item]` ring is gone with the template
 * that needed it; the `⋮` menu is the kit menu every other Studio surface opens (§12.5), so there
 * is no second list of actions.
 *
 * This module is also the single definition site for the structural selection verbs — move
 * up/down/in/out and the component pair — because their implementations live here.
 * {@link registerSelectionCommands} is what a host bootstrap calls to put them in the app-wide
 * registry; until one exists, {@link selectionCommandRegistry} builds the surface's own.
 *
 * A record's `icon` is a name in the UI KIT's manifest, so `commandIconMap` — the lit-side Spectrum
 * alias every button used to be drawn through — is gone with the template that needed it.
 * `jx-action-button` takes the name; nothing looks a glyph up any more.

 * every Windows machine — and lived in a hand-written `keydown` switch that returned early whenever
 * focus was inside the canvas iframe, which is exactly when a caret exists. Inside the frame
 * `iframe-keys.ts` refused to forward them "because the engine handles them", and the engine did
 * not: the parent's `editor/inline-edit.ts` keydown listener is attached to the BLOCK while the
 * editing host is the canvas container, and `canvas/editable-actions.ts` rejects the browser's own
 * `formatBold` because Jx owns its markup. So ⌘B in the canvas did nothing at all, in an app whose
 * toolbar advertised it.
 *
 * They are the case UX-REDESIGN-PLAN §5.1 uses to justify two fields, so they are written the way
 * it says: `level: "selection"` — a range inside the selected node is still the selection, and a
 * fifth `range` level would demand a fifth region — with `keyScope: "caret"`, which is what makes
 * the chord live only where a caret is. They were, until this change, the only capability in Studio
 * with a chord and no record.
 *
 * **The set is the schema's, the verbs are the registry's.** `data/elements-meta.json` says which
 * of the eight a given tag accepts (`$inlineActions`), so the bar draws four on an `<h1>` and eight
 * on a `<p>`; what each one is CALLED, which chord it holds and what it does are on the record.
 * That is the same division P5.3 made for value sources — caps derive from the schema, behaviour
 * does not.
 *
 * `when` is {@link CommandContext.caret.inCanvas} and not `caret.active`: the caret stack is live
 * in every parent-realm text field too, and ⌘K firing there would re-mount the link popover over
 * the URL the author is typing into it.
