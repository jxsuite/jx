/**
 * Navigator-panels.ts — the Navigator's panel set, composed once.
 *
 * The counterpart to `commands/app-commands.ts`: every record is DEFINED beside the state it
 * writes, in the module that owns the surface, and this file is the ONE place that composes them.
 * Nothing here decides what a panel is called, what level it is, or what it draws — that would be
 * the second definition site the registry exists to prevent.
 *
 * **Registration order is rail order** within a level group: PROJECT (Files ⌘1 · Search ⌘2 · Source
 * Control ⌘3) above the divider, DOCUMENT (Outline ⌘4 · Page ⌘5 · Data ⌘6 · Packages ⌘7) below it.
 *
 * **Every rail button opens the Navigator.** Problems used to hold the fourth PROJECT slot while
 * its body was drawn in the Bottom dock, and paying for that took a per-dock branch in three
 * separate places. A permanent button that opens something somewhere else is also a standing
 * advertisement, in the shell's own furniture, for a place to find things wrong with the product.
 * The count reaches the user from the status bar the moment there is one.
 *
 * **Search is declared and hidden.** It is a surface a later phase builds (P3.3's palette index),
 * and it holds a rail slot §3.2 has already spent. A `when: () => false` record is the honest way
 * to say "this exists in the design and not yet in the app": the id is reserved, the budget already
 * counts it, and the day it ships the only edit is deleting one predicate — as opposed to a stub
 * button that lies to whoever clicks it.
