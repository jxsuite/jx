/**
 * Right panel — the Inspector dock: four tabs, one dock, one column.
 *
 * **Content · Style · Logic · Assistant**, text-labelled. Three of those are renames of what was
 * here (Properties→Content, Events→Logic) and the fourth is the assistant, folded in from the fifth
 * grid column it used to own — which is the point of plan §3.2 ⑨: an inspector tab costs zero
 * additional width, so the canvas gets the ~300px back and the assistant is still one key away.
 *
 * Two things changed shape to make that work:
 *
 * - **The tabs are words, not icons.** Three icon-only tabs with `title` attributes meant three hover
 *   probes to learn a dock you look at all day, and the icons were `sp-icon-properties` /
 *   `sp-icon-event` / `sp-icon-brush` — a form, a lightning bolt and a paintbrush, none of which
 *   says "this is where the link target lives".
 * - **The containers are permanent.** The no-document state used to drop and rebuild them; it now
 *   renders INTO the three document tabs, because the Assistant's DOM (composer draft, scroll
 *   position, mounted document) must survive a document closing — the assistant works with no
 *   project at all, which is exactly the New Project hand-off's requirement.
 *
 * Every tab renders under a header naming its target (§3.2 ⑨), the same treatment wave A gave the
 * Navigator panels. The Target Line proper — provenance-coded, cascade-aware — is §6 and P5; this
 * is its honest predecessor: the tab's name, and what it is pointed at.
 *
 * The heavy sub-templates (properties, style) remain in their own modules and are passed the ctx
 * they need.
