/**
 * Layers panel — the Outline: the document tree, with collapse, selection, drag-and-drop
 * reordering, and per-row actions that are RENDERINGS of the command registry.
 *
 * Three things this file is deliberate about.
 *
 * **Rows are `registry.forPlacement("outline/row")`.** Every row used to carry five hand-built
 * action buttons, always visible, on every row — five custom elements with shadow roots per visible
 * row. They now collapse to the selected row plus the hovered one, which is Gutenberg's rule and
 * the one plan §3.2 ⑩ codifies: the floating bar owns selection-scoped verbs, the inspector owns
 * values. The verbs, their names, their chords and their disabled reasons all come from the records
 * in `block-action-bar.ts` — the surface renders, it does not decide.
 *
 * The hovered row's cluster is mounted imperatively ({@link mountHoverActions}) rather than by a
 * `display: none` CSS rule, because a hidden `sp-action-button` is still an upgraded custom element
 * with a shadow root: CSS reveal would have kept the whole cost the collapse exists to remove. At
 * most two clusters exist at any moment — the selected row's, and the one under the pointer.
 *
 * **A row says something.** On a real page the tree was a wall of rows all reading "div": only
 * text-bearing nodes got a preview and containers got the tag they already wear as a coloured
 * badge. {@link outlineLabel} derives an identity instead — a title, an `$id`, a class, a landmark
 * name, the first text inside — and returns "" rather than repeat the badge.
 *
 * **It is a tree, and it is reachable.** `role="tree"` / `role="treeitem"` with a roving tabindex
 * and the arrow-key model ARIA specifies: ↑↓ walk the visible rows, → expands then descends, ←
 * collapses then ascends, Enter/F2 renames.
 *
 * **The rows are a MODEL, and the DOM holds a window onto it** ({@link OutlineRow}, `ui/
 * virtual-window.ts`). A 5 000-node page drew 5 000 rows, each carrying an `sp-icon` custom
 * element, on every repaint. It now draws the viewport plus three rows of overscan — and because
 * the DOM is no longer the whole list, nothing may ASK the DOM what the whole list is. Every
 * question about "which rows exist, and in what order" — the shift-range, the arrow walk, Home/End,
 * ←'s climb to the parent, the reveal that follows the selection — is answered from the array
 * {@link buildOutlineRows} produces. A shift-range read off the DOM would silently select the wrong
 * set the moment either end of it scrolled out of the window: a correctness bug wearing a
 * performance change's clothes.
