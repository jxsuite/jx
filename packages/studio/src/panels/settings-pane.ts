/**
 * The Project Settings editor, drawn inside the pane — the stage, not an overlay.
 *
 * Two columns: the section list (inner nav) and the section body. It is deliberately the same
 * two-column shape the modal had, because the modal's IA was never the problem — its MODALITY was.
 * Moving the identical layout into `#canvas-wrap` is what makes the seven screenshot crops change
 * frame (`overlay.dialog:settings` → `pane.primary`) without one manifest STEP changing, which is
 * §13.7's proof that the command boundary was drawn in the right place.
 *
 * Mounting follows `grid/grid-panel.ts`: `canvas/canvas-render.ts` calls {@link renderSettingsPane}
 * when the tab enters this mode, and this module owns its reactivity from there — a subscription to
 * the section registry and to the chosen section, so an extension's section appearing a tick later
 * redraws the nav without the canvas being re-rendered.
 *
 * **It imports the registry, never the sections.** `canvas-render.ts` reaches this module, so
 * anything it imports joins the canvas's import graph; the section RENDERERS are registered by
 * `settings/settings-document.ts`, which the app loads when it registers its commands.
 *
 * Nothing here is stamped with a region of its own. `#canvas-wrap` already carries `pane.primary`
 * (the frame, `shell/tree.ts`), the entry rows and the entry editor are stamped by
 * `settings/contributed-section.ts` as `pane.primary/entry:<key>` and `pane.primary/editor`, and a
 * third id for "the settings body" would be a hand-stamped region with nothing to say.
