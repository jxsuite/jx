/**
 * The Logic dock's CODE surface — the Monaco function-body editor and its state-scope completions.
 *
 * It used to take over the canvas: `renderFunctionEditor` cleared `canvasWrap`, dropped every
 * canvas panel and mounted Monaco over the stage, so the page whose handler you were writing was
 * the one thing you could not see while writing it. It is a surface of the Bottom dock's **Logic**
 * tab now (plan §12 P8.5); `panels/formula-workspace.ts` owns that tab's record and calls the two
 * exports below — {@link syncFunctionEditor} from the panel's `afterRender`, and
 * {@link closeFunctionEditor} for its Close. The container is no longer one of them: the Logic tab
 * is a Jx document (`surfaces/logic-workspace.json`) and it draws the empty
 * {@link CODE_HOST_SELECTOR} node itself, which is what an island is (studio-ui-guidelines.md
 * §9.4). The canvas keeps rendering the page underneath the dock; `canvas/canvas-render.ts` no
 * longer knows this surface exists.
 *
 * **The mount is driven by the DOM, not by a render call.** A dock tab's body is re-rendered
 * whenever anything it reads changes, and a repaint will happily replace the container element out
 * from under a live Monaco instance (switching to the formula surface and back does exactly that).
 * So `syncFunctionEditor` asks the one question that matters — is the editor I hold still inside
 * the container I was just handed? — and rebuilds when the answer is no. Re-checking the target
 * string alone, which is all the takeover ever did, would have left a detached editor holding the
 * user's unsaved body.
 *
 * **The move changed the REPAINT rate, not just the teardown rate, and the repaint is the one that
 * runs with the user's hands on the keyboard.** The dock's `afterRender` effect tracks every badge
 * in the strip — Problems' count, Activity's running list, Source Control's file count, which git
 * polls every 30 seconds — so this module's sync runs on events that have nothing to do with the
 * code surface. Every write below therefore asks `services/monaco-buffer.ts` whether the buffer has
 * moved on first. Identity ("is this still the same editor?") is the OTHER question, still asked
 * where it applies, and it is passed by a repaint into a live editor mid-word.

/**
 * Drop the function editor, its model, and the debounced work armed over it. Safe to call when
 * there is nothing to drop.
 *
 * **What happens to the armed commit is the whole correctness of the teardown.** Monaco's
 * `dispose()` runs `_detachModel()`, and `CodeEditorWidget.getValue()` opens with `if
 * (!this._modelData) return "";`. A disposed editor therefore answers the EMPTY STRING, not the
 * buffer it was holding. The mount arms a 500ms timer that reads `getValue()` and writes it into
 * the document, so every surviving timer was a scheduled deletion of the user's handler:
 *
 * - Type, then click Problems / the dock's × / ⌘\ to another pane — `syncFunctionEditor` disposes
 *   synchronously, and half a second later the body is `""` and the tab is dirty.
 * - Worse, click **Close** — `closeFunctionEditor` minifies, writes the correct body, disposes, and
 *   the orphan timer overwrites that correct write with `""`. The action that exists to save the
 *   work was the one that destroyed it.
 *
 * The takeover never saw this because it was torn down by exactly one thing (closing it, which
 * happened to be slower than the debounce). A dock tab is torn down by five, four of them new in
 * P8. Handling it here rather than guarding inside each callback is deliberate: a guard on "is this
 * still the current editor?" is passed by a timer that fires after a REMOUNT.
 *
 * **But cancelling alone is the same loss with the alarm switched off.** The armed commit IS the
 * last half-second of typing; dropping it means the pre-typing body survives instead of an empty
 * one, and `doc.dirty` stays `false`, so nothing anywhere says an edit went missing. Five ways out
 * of the surface measured as silent loss — switching the dock tab, opening another target, opening
 * a formula through `openLogicTarget`, collapsing the dock, and a same-target switch to another
 * TAB. {@link commitBufferWrites} reads the buffer while it is still alive, writes it to the tab it
 * was mounted for, and only then drops what is left. The order is the fix, not the call.
 *
 * **Seven, and the last two are not this function's.** ⌘W / the tab × and quitting destroy the TAB:
 * `closeTab` deletes it from `workspace.tabs` before any repaint reaches this disposer, so the
 * commit flushed here finds `tabIsLive(tab) === false` and correctly writes nothing. Those two are
 * fixed at the gate that decides — `services/monaco-buffer.ts`'s `commitTabBuffers` runs the commit
 * while the tab is still open, and `tabBufferUnsaved` answers for typing no commit could land.
 *
 * **AND THE COMMIT IS ALLOWED TO FAIL, at which point this is a deletion.** The collab freeze
 * refuses the body write outright; a collaborator deleting the element the handler hangs off leaves
 * `editing.path` resolving to nothing. Either way `commitBufferWrites` returns false, and the very
 * next line detaches the model — so `buffersForTab` stops finding the buffer and `tabBufferUnsaved`
 * goes back to answering "nothing to lose" about text that no longer exists anywhere.
 *
 * Refusing the teardown is not on offer here, which is why the answer is a message rather than a
 * bail-out: every caller is a repaint or a mode transition that has ALREADY replaced the container
 * (the dock's `afterRender`, `closeFunctionEditor`'s tail), so keeping the instance would keep a
 * live Monaco bound to detached DOM — the leak `syncFunctionEditor` exists to close, and an editor
 * the author cannot see or reach is not a rescued edit. `closeFunctionEditor` is where a refusal
 * DOES keep the surface, because it is a gesture and the surface is still standing.

/**
 * The one way a body is written into a document, bound to the tab and target it is for.
 *
 * Two callers used to carry their own copy of this def/event branch — the 500ms commit and the
 * Close — and each resolved the tab it wrote to at CALL time, through `activeTab.value`. That is
 * "whatever is focused now", which is the tab the buffer came from only when nothing happened in
 * between. Bound here instead, at mount, so the two cannot answer differently and neither can
 * answer with a document the buffer was never filled from.
 *
 * `tabIsLive` rather than "is it active": the write belongs to its tab whether or not that tab is
 * the one on screen, and a tab that has been CLOSED is the one case where the write must not happen
 * at all — nothing would ever read it, and `transactDoc` would still push history and dirty a
 * document the user has already dismissed.
 *
 * **A WRITE IS ALLOWED TO BE REFUSED, and the buffer has to hear about it.** `transactDoc` consults
 * the collab gate, which under the source-canonical freeze blocks every structural edit including
 * the lock holder's own — so this returns having changed nothing. Settling the buffer anyway told
 * `tabBufferUnsaved` (and therefore `shouldWarnOnClose` and `hasUnsavedTabs`) that the document had
 * been given the author's text when it had not, and every subsequent close discarded it without a
 * word. So the settle is conditional on the write LANDING, and the answer is handed back to the
 * caller: the debounce has nothing useful to do with it (the gate raises its own keyed toast on
 * every refusal), but the Close does — see {@link closeFunctionEditor} — and so does every
 * disposer, through `commitBufferWrites`.
 *
 * **Three ways it does not land, not one.** The tab is gone; the collab gate refuses; or the node
 * `editing.path` names has been deleted out from under the open editor, in which case there is no
 * coordinate to write to at all.
 *
 * @param {Tab} tab The document this buffer was filled from.
 * @param {EditingTarget} editing The def or event binding inside it.
 * @param {BufferWrites} [writes] The buffer's debounce holder, when there is a buffer: a completed
 *   write is precisely what settles clause 3.

/**
 * Close the code surface: minify what is in the buffer, write it back, and clear the target.
 *
 * The write is the reason the Close is a real one rather than a tab switch. It lived in `studio.ts`
 * beside the pane context bar's crumb, which was its only caller; the Logic tab's Close is the
 * second, and a body-saving routine that two surfaces call belongs beside the editor whose buffer
 * it reads.
 *
 * **The minify is an await, and a retarget fits inside it.** The buffer and the target are both
 * read BEFORE it; the teardown after it acts on whatever is mounted then. Open A, click Close, and
 * while `minify` is in flight click "Open in code editor" on B: the write still belongs to A and
 * still lands on A, but the dispose-and-clear would have killed B's live editor and closed a
 * document position the user had just asked for. So the write is unconditional and the TEARDOWN is
 * conditional — they answer to different moments in time and only one of them is still A's.
 *
 * **But that is TWO obligations, and only one of them is the editor's.** Guarding the whole tail on
 * `view.functionEditor === editor` conflated them, and the case it got wrong is the ordinary one:
 * an editor torn down inside the minify and NOT retargeted — collapse the dock, select Problems, ⌘\
 * to another pane — leaves `view.functionEditor` null, so the guard bailed and `editingFunction`
 * was never cleared. Nothing else clears it, so the Logic tab stayed on the strip pointing at a
 * body the user had just dismissed, and re-opening the dock restored the editor they closed.
 * Disposing belongs to the instance; clearing the target belongs to the TARGET, and the only thing
 * with a claim on the target is a retarget that already replaced it.
 *
 * **The write goes through the editor's own `_commitBody`, not through the focused tab.** That
 * writer was bound at mount to the tab and target this buffer belongs to, so the Close and the
 * debounce cannot land in different places. An editor handle this module did not mount carries no
 * writer, and then the only meaning the gesture has left is its own tab and its own target — the
 * same {@link bodyWriter}, bound to those.
 *
 * **AND THE WRITE CAN BE REFUSED, in which case there is nothing left to close over.** Under the
 * source-canonical freeze the collab gate blocks the body commit, and this used to carry on:
 * minify, refused write, `cancelBufferWrites` (the armed commit gone too), dispose, target cleared.
 * The Close button — the one action whose entire purpose is to save the body — destroyed it, and
 * the standing "frozen" chip in the presence strip does not say that a button just did nothing. A
 * refusal therefore keeps the surface exactly as it is (the text stays on screen, the target stays
 * open) and says why, once, through the same Problems/toast channel every other failed write uses.
 * Nothing is re-armed: the buffer is still marked typed, so the close and quit gates already know
 * the work exists.
