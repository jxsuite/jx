/**
 * Problems — everything that must be fixed, listed until it is (plan §7.1, §7.2).
 *
 * `services/notify.ts` landed the RECORD in P4 wave A: a failure is a `Notification` with `tier:
 * "problem"`, which means the app promises to keep it until somebody fixes it. This is the surface
 * that keeps the promise. Until it existed, `problems` was a reactive array with a count (the rail
 * badge, the status bar) and no way to read what was in it.
 *
 * A row is the record, rendered:
 *
 * | Field      | Renders as                                                                 |
 * | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
 * | `severity` | the glyph and the row's colour                                             |
 * | `message`  | the line                                                                   |
 * | `source`   | the group heading — "Save", "Source Control", "Canvas", "Assistant"        |
 * | `path`     | a button that opens the file it names                                      |
 * | `detail`   | a disclosure with the captured log (an Activity failure puts its log here) |
 * | `action`   | a REAL button, built from the command record, not a per-call-site closure  |
 *
 * **The recovery button is the command.** Its label is the command's title, its disabled state is
 * the command's `enablement`, and its tooltip is the command's `requires` sentence — four facts a
 * callback could carry none of, and the reason `NotifyOptions.action` is a command id. A row whose
 * command the registry does not have renders no button at all, rather than a dead one.
 *
 * **One record, one host.** Problems lives in the BOTTOM DOCK — plan §7.2's table says so outright
 * ("Problems | Bottom dock ⑪, badge on the rail") and §3.2 ⑪ makes it the dock's first tab. §3.2 ③
 * also lists it among the Navigator's panels; that line loses, because a list open in two docks at
 * once is two hosts for one record, and hosting it in the Navigator spends left-dock width on
 * something that belongs under the pane grid.
 *
 * **And no rail button.** It had one, in the PROJECT group, which meant a control on the far left
 * that opened a dock along the bottom — the rail carried a per-dock branch in three places to keep
 * that one button honest. It also made "things are wrong here" a permanent fixture of the shell,
 * which is a poor first thing to promise someone opening the product. The warning count in the
 * status bar is the standing signal, and it runs `view.setBottomTab { tab: "problems" }` — the same
 * verb Diff, Logic and Activity are reached by.
