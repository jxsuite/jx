/**
 * Chat-view.js — the active-conversation templates: header and message list.
 *
 * Message-row anatomy: user messages render as right-aligned bubbles (attached-context
 * blocks become chips), assistant messages render sanitized markdown plus tool-call
 * chips, tool messages surface failures only (ADR §11.3), the streaming tail renders
 * as plain text with a cursor (markdown parses once on finalize), and chat errors get
 * a danger row with recovery advice and a Retry. Templates only — chat state lives in ai-panel, and
 * the three buttons are records the registry holds (see below).
 *
 * §7.4 (AI honesty) is why three things here are not what they were:
 *
 * - **A chip renders its OUTCOME.** `ToolCallRecord.result` has always been populated by the loop
 *   and ignored by this renderer, so a chip that said `update_style: ["children",0]` said exactly
 *   as much when the edit had been refused as when it had landed.
 * - **A turn renders what it CHANGED.** The changed-files summary comes off the write ledger
 *   (`services/ai-writes.ts`), which records whether each change went through a transaction or
 *   straight to disk — so the undo caveat is rendered to the human holding ⌘Z instead of being
 *   appended to the model-facing tool summary.
 * - **An error offers Retry.** `chatState.retryLast()` has been implemented, exported and called by
 *   nobody; the error row is where it belongs.
 *
 * §11.1 is why the three buttons here are not callbacks any more. History, New Chat and Retry were
 * closures this module received and invoked, so the capabilities existed ONLY as buttons: the
 * `Assistant` category held zero records, and nothing could reach them from the palette, a chord,
 * the automation runner or the generated commands sheet. They run {@link commandButton} now, in the
 * idiom `surfaces/statusbar.ts` established — the record is the definition site, and this file only
 * decides where it is drawn.
