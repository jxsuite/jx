/**
 * ⑪ · Logic — the formula workspace and the function editor, hosted by the Bottom dock.
 *
 * **What changed, and why it is the whole point.** Both of these surfaces used to TAKE OVER the
 * canvas: `TabUi.editingFormula` (this file) and `TabUi.editingFunction` (`panels/editors.ts`) each
 * cleared `canvasWrap`, dropped every canvas panel and drew themselves over the stage. So the one
 * artefact whose values you are authoring — the page — was the one thing you could not see while
 * authoring them, and the workspace's own data rail existed to paper over it: a frozen snapshot of
 * a scope, shown because the live thing had just been unmounted. Plan §12 P8.5: "no editor hides
 * the page it computes." They are a **tab of the Bottom dock** now (§3.2 ⑪), which sits under the
 * pane grid, so the page renders beside the formula and keeps rendering while you edit it.
 *
 * **A dock tab is not a reparented takeover.** The surface has to work at dock height, so the
 * header is one row, the chip pipeline and the result are single lines, the data rail is a narrow
 * column that scrolls rather than a 280px slab, and every measurement lives in `styles/panels.css`
 * instead of the inline `style=` attributes that kept seventeen `fw-*` classes on
 * `scripts/check-styles.ts`'s orphan list.
 *
 * **One target, two surfaces, one tab.** {@link logicTarget} is the single reader of the two
 * `TabUi` fields, and the function editor wins when both are set — the precedence `tabs/tab.ts` has
 * always documented, now stated in exactly one place. The tab's `when` is that same predicate, so
 * Logic exists only while something is open in it, and `panels/bottom-dock.ts` reveals the dock on
 * that tab when a target appears.
 *
 * **The close is real.** Both surfaces carry one, and closing is the only thing that clears the
 * target — leaving the dock, switching tabs and collapsing the dock all keep your place, because
 * the editor no longer owns a screen it would otherwise be stranded on.
 *
 * Every edit immutably replaces the selected sub-node within the root and writes the WHOLE root
 * node back through `transactDoc` — undo/redo and the canvas patch come free, and because the
 * canvas is still mounted the patch lands in a page you can watch.
