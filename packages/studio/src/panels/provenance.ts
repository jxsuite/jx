/**
 * Provenance — where the value in a field came from, as one chip (plan §6.2).
 *
 * Four states, and the two that carry information NAME THEIR SOURCE:
 *
 * | State     | Rendering                         | Click             |
 * | --------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
 * | set       | accent dot                        | clear the value   |
 * | inherited | amber, "from Base" / "from Md"    | jump to the donor |
 * | default   | nothing — absence IS the ghost    | —                 |
 * | bound     | violet, naming the signal/formula | open the source   |
 * | mixed     | neutral, "mixed (3)" — see below  | clear across all  |
 *
 * **Mixed** is what a multi-selection says when the selected elements disagree about a field
 * (§6.5). It is a fifth state of THIS chip rather than a fifth widget, because it answers the same
 * question the other four answer — _where did the value in this box come from?_ — and the honest
 * answer is "from several places, and they differ". It names how many elements are involved, so
 * "mixed" never has to mean "some unknown number of things". Typing into a Mixed field commits the
 * new value to every selected element in one transaction; the chip's click clears it from all of
 * them, which is the same verb `set` has, applied to the same set.
 *
 * `set` and `default` are the only two the inspector could previously express, and it expressed
 * them as a dot or the absence of one. The other two were known at render time and thrown away: an
 * inherited style value arrived as an input placeholder, visually indistinguishable from the CSS
 * initial value `style-inputs.ts` renders into the same slot, and a `${…}`-bound value looked like
 * a literal that happened to contain braces.
 *
 * **One module, two cascades.** The Style tab reads provenance against the breakpoint / scheme /
 * site-token cascade; Component Props reads it against the component's declared defaults. Same
 * question, same words, same chip — so the two surfaces cannot drift into two vocabularies for one
 * idea. The chip's CSS lives in `styles/inspector.css` beside `.set-dot`, which the `set` state
 * reuses outright: a 6px accent dot that clears the value on click is exactly what the set state
 * has always been, and every stylesheet rule and test that addresses `.set-dot` keeps addressing
 * the same thing.
