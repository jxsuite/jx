/**
 * Languages — which pages exist in which locale, and which do not.
 *
 * Jx has no message catalogue. A translation is a DIFFERENT FILE in a different directory
 * (`pages/fr/about.json` beside `pages/about.json`, `specs/site-architecture.md` §13.3), and that
 * is why nothing in the shell could answer "is this site translated": the Files panel draws `fr/`
 * the way it draws any other directory, and a page nobody has translated is invisible precisely
 * because the file that would prove it does not exist.
 *
 * So this panel is a grid over ABSENCE. One row per translation key — the path with its locale
 * segment taken out, which is what makes two files the same page — and one column per declared
 * locale. A cell says one of three things:
 *
 * | Cell      | Means                                                         | Its button         |
 * | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
 * | `present` | the file is there                                             | opens it           |
 * | `stale`   | it is there, and older than the source it was translated from | opens it, and says |
 * | `missing` | it is not there, and this is where it would go                | creates it         |
 *
 * **Every button is a command, run by id through the registry** — never a direct call, for the
 * reason `panels/problems-panel.ts` gives about its recovery button: the registry is what makes the
 * action reachable from the palette and from automation, and it is where the refusal sentence comes
 * from. A cell whose command this window has not registered is drawn disabled with that as its
 * tooltip, rather than as a button that does nothing.
 *
 * **Off the rail.** `railDeclarations()` does not apply `when`, so a rail button here would spend
 * the last `rail/project` slot in every monolingual project and shift every document panel's ⌘1–8
 * chord by one. `i18n.showParity` is how this panel is reached.
