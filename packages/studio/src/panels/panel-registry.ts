/**
 * Panel-registry.ts — one definition site per panel.
 *
 * A {@link PanelRecord} is to a surface what a `Command` is to an action: its name, the containment
 * level of the state it WRITES, the dock that hosts it, the predicate that decides whether it
 * exists at all, and the function that draws it. The rail, the panel header and the dock budget
 * become RENDERINGS of these records — plan §2 principle 1, applied to regions rather than verbs.
 *
 * It mirrors the shipped `settings/settings-modal.ts` contribution point
 * (`registerSettingsSection`) deliberately: a module-level `Map`, keyed by id, written by the
 * module that OWNS the surface. The one thing it adds is the field that makes the rail derivable —
 *
 * **`level` is required, and it is the level of the state the panel WRITES, not the state it
 * reads** (plan §2 principle 3). Insert reads the project's component registry and writes the
 * document tree, so it is `document`. Files reads documents and writes project files, so it is
 * `project`. That rule, and not intuition, is what settles every contested placement and what stops
 * the rail re-accreting: the two rail groups are two rows of
 * {@link
 * import("../commands/levels").PANEL_PLACEMENT_MATRIX}, checked at registration exactly the
 * way a command's `menus` are.
 *
 * The predecessor was an eight-item array literal inside `panels/activity-bar.ts` — `{icon, label,
 * value}` — beside an eight-branch `if` chain in `panels/left-panel.ts` and a third list in
 * `shell.ts`. Three places to keep in step, none of which recorded what a panel was FOR.
