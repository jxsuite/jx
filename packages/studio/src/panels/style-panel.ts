/**
 * Style panel — CSS property editor under the **Target Line** (§6.1), with provenance-coded rows
 * (§6.2), a section accordion, shorthand expand/compress, and a property filter.
 *
 * The panel resolves a compound coordinate before it can commit anything: `(selection, breakpoint,
 * scheme layer, nested selector)`. It has always computed that tuple — it is the per-field key and
 * the five-branch if/else below — and it used to hide it behind three disconnected widgets on two
 * different bars. `target-line.ts` renders it as one sentence instead, and the three widgets are
 * gone: the breakpoint and scheme axes are selected on the pane context bar (region ⑦), and the
 * selector is the one axis this tab owns.
 *
 * Every row then says where its value came from. `provenance.ts` supplies the chip;
 * `computeInheritedSources()` supplies the donor breakpoint the cascade walk always knew and this
 * panel used to throw away.

 * press — the element comes from the Target Line's own `ref`, so a refactor of that markup moves
 * the handle with it. The menu it opens is now a segment of the Target Line rather than a picker on
 * a retired toolbar; the id, and therefore the shot, is unchanged.
