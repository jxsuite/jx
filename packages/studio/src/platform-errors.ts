/**
 * Structured platform errors. Backend routes attach machine-readable fields to failures (e.g.
 * project creation blocked by missing GitHub App installation access → `code:
 * "needs_installation_access"` + `installUrl`); adapters preserve them on the thrown Error via
 * `Object.assign`, and UI surfaces recover them here to render actions (an install link) instead of
 * plain text.
 *
 * **RFC 9457 reconciles cleanly with this, because a problem's `type` IS the code.** A backend
 * answering `type: "https://jxsuite.com/problems/needs-installation-access"` is saying exactly what
 * `code: "needs_installation_access"` said; `problemSlug` derives the one from the other, and
 * `installUrl` is the extension member (RFC 9457 §3.2) that type documents. So this module reads
 * both, and every surface above it keeps branching on `code` without knowing which shape arrived.
