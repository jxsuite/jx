/**
 * Convert-file — moving one document between formats, in place.
 *
 * A conversion IS a rename with the bytes rewritten on the way, and that framing is what makes it
 * safe: `platform.renameFile` is the only door to the backend's refactor pass, so going through it
 * is what rewrites every `$ref`/`$src` that pointed at the old name. Writing a new file beside the
 * old one and deleting it would leave every reference dangling.
 *
 * **The bytes are written BEFORE the rename**, which is the one ordering decision in this file.
 * `applyRename` (`packages/server/src/refactor/apply.ts`) runs AFTER the move and `loadDoc`s every
 * document in the project — including the one that just moved, for tag derivation and for its own
 * references. Renaming first would hand it markdown at a `.json` path, which throws into
 * `report.errors`, silently skips tag derivation, and leaves the moved file's own references
 * unrewritten. Writing first means the file parses at every point the refactor looks at it, which
 * is also why `report.errors` can be surfaced unfiltered afterwards: the only entry that can appear
 * means a reference really was left stale.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches the DOM at import time. `packages/studio/tests/app-commands.test.ts` imports
 * the command surface in a bare Bun process and asserts empty stderr, so every module that touches
 * `document` — the dialogs, the workspace, the file layer — is reached through `await import()`.
