/**
 * What `@jxsuite/studio` ships, where it goes, and how a host addresses it.
 *
 * The package's internal cross-references are already correct and self-locating — `dist/studio.css`
 * reaches `./codicon.ttf`, `styles/tokens.css` reaches `../fonts/*.woff2`, the entry reaches
 * `./chunks/*` and `./workers/*`. What it never shipped was a STATEMENT that they are, so four
 * hosts re-derived the file list by hand, two of them flattened the tree, that broke the
 * references, and they rewrote the shipped HTML to compensate. This module is the statement.
 *
 * **Pure by contract.** No `node:`, no DOM, nothing beyond the language — so a wrangler build, a
 * Vite plugin, a Deno host or a Nix derivation can read it. `./hosting` (stage.ts) is the `node:fs`
 * convenience the two Bun consumers share, and it is the only entry that binds a runtime. The build
 * also emits `dist/manifest.json` from {@link STUDIO_ASSETS} for a host that cannot import
 * TypeScript at all.
 *
 * **It names no adapter, no backend and no transport.** `@jxsuite/studio` may contain PAL adapters
 * — `platforms/devserver.ts` and `platforms/cloud.ts` both ship, the latter because it owns the
 * collab client's `Y.Doc` and a second bundled `yjs` breaks cross-module `instanceof` — but it must
 * not depend on a backend PACKAGE. `scripts/check-dep-rules.ts` cannot catch a violation (it
 * forbids only core-to-extension edges, and server and studio are both core), so
 * `scripts/check-studio-package.ts` does.
