/**
 * Virtual-window.ts — the windowing primitive behind every long list in Studio.
 *
 * **Why this is the acceptance criterion and not a nicety.** The Manage view the Library replaces
 * rendered one card per file with no cap, and each Pages/Layouts/Components/Content card mounted a
 * REAL `@jxsuite/runtime` render of that document. Opening "All" on a 300-page project therefore
 * built 300 live documents, in one synchronous lit pass, and kept every one of them alive in an
 * unbounded `Map`. The window is what makes the cost proportional to the VIEWPORT instead of to the
 * project. The two trees pay a smaller version of the same bill — a 5 000-node page drew 5 000
 * rows, each an `sp-icon` custom element — and they now pay it through this file.
 *
 * **It lives in `ui/`, not in `browse/`.** P3 workstream 11 promised "one virtual-list primitive
 * behind the Files tree and the Outline tree, reused by the Library grid", and what shipped sat
 * inside the Library and was imported by the Library alone. A primitive two surfaces share cannot
 * live inside one of them: the next surface that needs it either reaches across a feature boundary
 * or writes a second copy, and a second copy is how "the tree renders every row" survived a phase
 * that had already solved it.
 *
 * The maths is deliberately a pure function ({@link computeWindow}) rather than a class: it is the
 * part that has to be right, it is the part the perf test measures, and it needs no DOM to state.
 * {@link createVirtualWindow} is the thin observer that feeds it scroll positions, and the
 * {@link nearestScroller} half below is the small amount of DOM a list that does NOT own its own
 * scrollbar needs — both trees scroll inside `#left-panel`, which also holds their toolbars.
 *
 * One primitive, three surfaces: the Library (Table rows, Cards, Media), the Files tree and the
 * Outline. The geometry never mentions what an item IS.

 * the row height changes the list's box by `drawn × Δ`, and observing the list is what turns that
 * into the ask. It is deliberately not an observer on `data-density`: Studio writes no such
 * attribute (the kit declares the rule and a consumer sets it), and the same drift follows a late
