/**
 * Timing.ts — Studio's latency vocabulary.
 *
 * Every user-visible delay in Studio expresses one of a small number of intents: "wait until the
 * user stops typing", "hold a message on screen long enough to read", "check the repo again". Each
 * call site used to pick its own number for its intent, so the same intent shipped as 350, 400 and
 * 600 ms in three different panels and a retune meant a grep. Name the intent once here, import the
 * name, and the retune is a single edit.
 *
 * All values are milliseconds. The two input debounces are contractual:
 * `specs/studio-ui-guidelines.md` §4.4 fixes 400 ms for text inputs and 500 ms for code/expression
 * textareas. Do not change either without releasing that spec section.
 */

/**
 * Text/style input debounce — the studio-ui-guidelines.md §4.4 standard. Long enough that a normal
 * typing cadence produces one commit per pause rather than one per keystroke, short enough that the

 * Code and expression textareas — the studio-ui-guidelines.md §4.4 standard. Longer than
