/**
 * Regions — the shell's addressable surfaces, in one id space.
 *
 * `shell.ts` declares `FocusRegion = "rail" | "navigator" | "pane" | "inspector" | "dock" |
 * "status"` and has done since the shell record landed. It is an enum with **no DOM counterpart**:
 * nothing can be asked where the Navigator _is_, so nothing can move focus into it, cycle to the
 * next one, or measure it. Three consumers want exactly that map — F6 region cycling, focus
 * restoration after a toast or a Problems jump, and the screenshot pipeline, which today addresses
 * the shell through sixteen CSS selectors, seven of which name nodes the shell redesign deletes.
 *
 * **The grammar** (UX-REDESIGN-PLAN §13.2) is `<surface>[.<instance>][/<part>]`:
 *
 * ```text
 * navigator                     the Navigator dock
 * navigator/panel:git           the Source Control panel inside it
 * navigator/panel:git/commit    a leaf within that panel
 * inspector/tab:style           the Style tab's body
 * inspector/field:href          a field row (the Inspector's documents already emit `data-prop`)
 * pane.primary/tabs             the primary pane's own tab strip
 * overlay.dialog:settings       a named overlay slot
 * ```
 *
 * **Ids are DERIVED, not authored**, which is the property that makes them survive a rename. The
 * panel host stamps `navigator/panel:${id}` once and every panel gets a region for free; the
 * inspector stamps `inspector/tab:${key}` from its own tab records; `getLayerSlot()` stamps
 * `overlay.<kind>:<id>` from the key it already builds. A panel rename then propagates to the
 * region automatically, and a stale id fails the shot contract instead of photographing the wrong
 * box. Only leaves — `navigator/panel:git/commit` — are hand-stamped, and those are counted.
 *
 * Resolution reads the live DOM rather than a registration table, for the same reason
 * {@link import("./layers").isModalOpen} does: whatever is on screen is the answer, and there is no
 * bookkeeping for a new surface to forget.
