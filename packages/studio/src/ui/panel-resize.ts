 * Panel-resize.js — Draggable resize handles for the three docks.

 * Self-initializing module. Import it and the resize handles become interactive.
 *
 * The handles are the only thing here: dock sizes, their persistence and their projection onto the
 * grid's CSS custom properties all belong to the reactive `shell` record (`../shell`). A drag
 * writes `setDockSize()` and the shell's own effect moves the track; release persists once.

/**
 * What a handle drags.
 *
 * Generalised out of the three dock rows so the Edit column's own handle can be the fourth. Each is
 * sized in px against a different reference, which is the whole of the difference: `scale` converts
 * a pointer delta in px into the target's own units, and everything else — capture, the dragging
 * class, the text-selection suppression, the double-click reset, the one persist on release — is
 * identical and was worth having once.
 *
 * **The pane splitter was the fifth and is not any more**, and the reason is worth recording rather
 * than quietly dropping: this module binds pointer events and nothing else, so anything it drives
 * is unreachable from a keyboard. That is survivable for a dock, which has a command and a chord of
 * its own, and it was not for the pane split, which had neither — so the splitter is `jx-split`
 * (ui.md §5.5), an element with `role="separator"`, a tab stop, `aria-valuenow` and its own arrows.
 * Every remaining caller here still owes that door to somebody; see this module's own backlog note
 * in `specs/ui.md` §5.5.
