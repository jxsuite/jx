/**
 * Value Source — the one vocabulary for "how is this value produced", and the derivation that says
 * which productions a given document position actually permits (plan §6.3).
 *
 * Six controls used to answer that question in six dialects: `abc / $ref / ${} / fx` on the dynamic
 * slot, `inline / $expression / ref` on the Events tab, `lit / $ref / expr` on every expression
 * operand, and `Static value / route param / Custom…` in the schema-driven forms. They are the same
 * four rungs of the Rule of Least Power ladder (spec §2.2) wearing four costumes, and a user who
 * learned one learned none of the others. {@link VALUE_SOURCE_LABELS} is the single vocabulary;
 * every surface that offers the choice spells it the same way.
 *
 * **The rungs are derived, not declared.** Each call site used to hand-write the array of rungs it
 * believed legal — four arrays, none of which included `expression`, so the `fx` rung the UI drew
 * was unreachable from every Properties and Style field. {@link deriveSlotCaps} walks the real
 * subschema from `@jxsuite/schema/defs` instead, so the rungs on offer are exactly the shapes the
 * document schema (and therefore `jx validate` and the compiler) accepts at that position:
 *
 * - An attribute, a component prop or an element property → fixed / from-data / mixed-text;
 * - A CSS declaration → fixed / mixed-text, because `JxStyle` has no `$ref` branch at all;
 * - An event handler → from-data / formula / inline-function, and never a fixed value;
 * - A repeater's filter or sort, and a `$switch` discriminant → from-data and nothing else, because
 *   `ArrayNamespace` and `SwitchDef` declare a `RefObject` there and no other branch.
 *
 * The walker imports the _source_ def modules rather than the generated `schema.json`, which is
 * half a megabyte of webref data that `services/monaco-lazy.ts` deliberately keeps out of the cold
 * start. The one position the generator synthesises rather than declares — the `on*` handler
 * property — is mirrored here as {@link EVENT_HANDLER_SCHEMA} and pinned to the generated schema by
 * a test, so the mirror cannot drift in silence.
