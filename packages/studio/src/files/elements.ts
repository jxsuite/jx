/**
 * Elements.ts — what belongs in a document's (or a project's) `$elements`, decided once.
 *
 * `$elements` is the list of component modules a document may use. Three surfaces wrote it, each
 * with its own idea of what "already imported" means: the Packages panel's cherry-pick checkboxes,
 * its "Add component…" picker, and the automatic push when a component is dropped on the canvas.
 * §9.1.3 puts one `enableElement()` / `disableElement()` service behind all three, because the same
 * array was written three ways with no shared UI and no shared validation.
 *
 * They really did disagree. The canvas drop matched a local component by `ref.endsWith(basename)`,
 * so `./components/card.json` counted `./vendor/card.json` as already imported and the drop
 * silently produced an element the page could not resolve. The picker checked nothing at all and
 * pushed a duplicate `$ref` every time you chose the same component twice. Only the checkbox knew
 * that a legacy full-package entry (`@acme/ui`) satisfies a cherry-picked one (`@acme/ui/card`), so
 * enabling one component through the picker left the package-wide import beside it.
 *
 * **Pure functions over the array.** They return the new list rather than writing it, because the
 * two levels persist differently and genuinely should: a document's `$elements` goes through
 * `transact` and is undoable, and the project's goes through `updateSiteConfig` and is not. What
 * they must not differ on is WHICH entries the list should hold.
