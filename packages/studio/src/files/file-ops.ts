/**
 * File Operations — open, save, export documents, and confirm the destructive ones.
 *
 * All functions read/write directly from/to `activeTab.value` (the reactive tab). `.json` is the
 * native document format; every other extension dispatches through the project's format registry
 * (parse to open, serialize to save).
 *
 * {@link confirmFileDelete} and {@link renamePromptMessage} live here because a delete and a rename
 * are the same question asked twice — "what does this break?" — and the answer was missing from
 * both. Every surface that removes or moves a file routes its confirmation through them, so no
 * caller can ship a destructive dialog that grades only by reversibility again.
 *
 * Both answer in SENTENCES rather than in markup. The dialog is `surfaces/dialog.json` now, and a
 * `TemplateResult` reaches it only through the island seam — which is the right shape for a body
 * that is genuinely rich, and the wrong shape for one paragraph of prose: it put a `<strong>` and a
 * `<p class="dialog-consequence">` on this module's side of a boundary whose whole point is that
 * the document owns the markup. What the copy loses is the visual set-apart of the consequence
 * line; what it keeps is the consequence itself, in the same words, in the same dialog.
