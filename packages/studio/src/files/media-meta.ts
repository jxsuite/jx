/**
 * Media metadata — what a file IS, for surfaces that show media rather than resolve it.
 *
 * Three facts, and each has an "unknown" that is not a zero:
 *
 * - **Size and modified time** come from the directory listing the caller already performed. A media
 *   surface enumerates a directory to draw itself, so `seedMediaMeta` folds those entries in for
 *   free and {@link loadMediaMeta} is the fallback for a path nobody enumerated.
 * - **Pixel dimensions** are OPPORTUNISTIC. There is no stat that returns them and no decoder in the
 *   shell, so the only honest source is an `<img>` that already loaded — which every media surface
 *   renders anyway. {@link recordImageSize} is how that surface hands the number back, and until
 *   one does, the dimensions are `null` and the summary simply omits them. Downloading the file a
 *   second time to measure it would be a network request per thumbnail for a line of text.
 *
 * A missing number is `null` everywhere, never `0`. `0 × 0` and `0 B` are things a real file can
 * almost be, so they must not double as "we did not find out" — the same rule
 * `services/references.ts` applies to a count it cannot answer.
 *
 * The cache is dropped wholesale by {@link invalidateMediaMeta}, wired to the same post-upload
 * invalidation the media picker's listing uses. There is no TTL: a size that expires on a timer is
 * wrong at an unannounced moment.
 *
