/**
 * A tab's document, as the bytes a file would hold.
 *
 * Its own module because four callers need it and one of them is `file-ops` itself: the save path
 * writes what this returns, the source view shows it, the collab layer publishes it, and the live
 * preview overlay sends it. Leaving it in `file-ops` meant the overlay had to import the module
 * that imports the overlay, and the collab layer had already worked around the same shape by
 * injecting the function at boot. One home resolves both.
 *
 * That every one of them goes through this function is the point rather than an accident: what a
 * reader sees in a preview, what a peer sees in a session and what lands on disk are the same
 * bytes, so they cannot drift.
