/**
 * View.js — Transient view state for Jx Studio
 *
 * Holds DOM references, editor instances, cleanup functions, and other mutable state that is the
 * OUTPUT of renderers (not the input). Separating this from persistent app state (in S via
 * store.js) makes renderer dependencies explicit.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT reactive, and deliberately narrow: a Monaco instance, a live `ResizeObserver`
 * and detached DOM nodes must never be wrapped in a reactive proxy. UI _inputs_ — which panel a
 * dock shows, whether a dock is open, the layout selection — live on the reactive `shell` record in
 * `./shell`, where a renderer can track them by reading them.

 * different modules, torn down by different events and written into by different continuations —
 * and each of those differences used to justify its own spelling of the same two ideas ("ignore the
 * change my own `setValue` is about to fire" and "cancel the work armed over this buffer"). The
 * function editor got a canceller in P8 and the source view did not, which is exactly how a 600ms
 * timer survived three disposal sites and stayed able to replace a page with an empty parse.
 * `services/monaco-buffer.ts` owns the rule; this is the storage it needs.

 * array, where `bufferIsLive`, `getValue` and `_writes` are all code-editor APIs. It carries none
 * of that state because it has nothing to commit: both its models are read-only, and one of them is
 * a git object that does not exist on disk.
 *
 * `_diffKey` is the comparison it was mounted for, so a retarget to a different file disposes it
 * before claiming the next pair of URIs rather than throwing on a URI the previous mount still

   * `tabIsLive` whether the document it was promised to still exists.
   *
   * `_commitBody` is the one writer for both of them: a closure built at mount over that tab and
   * that target, so the debounce and the Close cannot disagree about where a body goes — and
   * neither can resolve it through whichever tab happens to be focused when they run.
   *
   * **It answers whether the body LANDED.** `transactDoc` can refuse a write outright (the collab
   * source-canonical freeze pauses structural edits for everyone, the lock holder included), and a
   * writer that reported nothing let the Close dispose an editor whose text had gone nowhere. The
   * boolean is what lets the caller keep the surface up instead.
