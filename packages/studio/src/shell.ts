/**
 * Shell — the reactive record of Jx Studio's UI _inputs_.
 *
 * Companion to `view.ts`, and the other half of the split that `view.ts` used to straddle:
 *
 * - `view` holds render **outputs** — Monaco instances, the panzoom wrap, observers, DOM refs and the
 *   per-render cleanup arrays. It stays a plain object, because wrapping a live editor instance and
 *   detached DOM nodes in a reactive proxy is an active hazard.
 * - `shell` (here) holds UI **inputs** — which panel each dock shows, whether each dock is open and
 *   how wide, the focused region, the layout preset, and the project-level state (source control,
 *   the stylebook selection, the settings tab) that a _document_ must not own.
 *
 * Because this record is reactive, a surface tracks it by reading it: the rail, the left panel and
 * the toolbar all repaint from the effects they already run. The stand-in that preceded this —
 * `onPanelCollapse(fn)` plus an explicit `render()` in every toggle handler — is deleted.
 *
 * **Project-level state does not live on the focused tab.** Git status is a property of the
 * project, not of whichever document happens to be open: sourcing it from `activeTab` meant the
 * rail's Source Control badge vanished when the last tab closed, and two tabs could disagree about
 * the branch. See specs/studio.md and the level × placement matrix.
