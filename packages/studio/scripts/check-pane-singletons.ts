/**
 * Guard the pane grid against the singletons it exists to remove.
 *
 * A pane is the unit of split, focus, zoom and RENDER (§18), so everything a stage owns — its
 * pan/zoom wrap, its centering observer, its pan offsets, its source-view Monaco, its render
 * generation — is a field of one pane's `CanvasSurface`, and everything drawn INTO a stage — the
 * grid engine, the Library, the entry form, the Project Settings editor, the Document Header card —
 * is one instance per pane. Both were app-level singletons, and both are the same defect: a fact
 * about one pane stored where only one pane can have it.
 *
 * **Neither can be caught by the type system, which is the whole reason this file exists.**
 * `ViewState` carries `[key: string]: unknown`, so `view.panX` is not an error — it is a silently
 * `unknown` read that `as number` makes compile. And a module-level `let active` is perfectly
 * well-typed; it is only wrong because there are two stages.
 *
 * Five rules, all in this package's own idiom (`scripts/check-styles.ts`'s `ALLOWED_ORPHANS`), and
 * all failing BOTH ways: a new occurrence fails, and a stale allow-list entry fails too, so the
 * lists can only ratchet down.
 *
 * **The third rule is the general form of the first, and it exists because the first was a list of
 * NAMES.** `BANNED_VIEW_FIELDS` catches per-stage state that used to live on `view`; the pan/zoom
 * SCALE never did. It was injected into `canvas/canvas-utils.ts` through `initCanvasUtils`, spelled
 * `activeTab.value?.session.ui.zoom` in the bootstrap — so a module whose every geometry function
 * took an explicit `CanvasSurface` still read and wrote ONE pane's zoom, and this checker was
 * silent about it through the whole of the shell redesign's panes phase. Four visible failures came
 * out of that silence: the unfocused pane drew at the focused tab's scale, the side pane's `+`
 * zoomed the primary's document, the unfocused zoom pod reported the focused pane's fit, and a pane
 * entering Design re-fitted the other one.
 *
 * So the rule that is checked is the one that was meant all along — **per-stage state is reached
 * through a surface** — and its mechanical form is: in the modules that compute stage geometry, the
 * FOCUSED tab is not an input. `activeTab` there means "whatever pane the keyboard is in", which is
 * never what a transform, a fit or a content zoom is about. The residue in the allow-list is the
 * command verbs, where "the active pane" is the whole meaning of the request.
 *
 * **The FOURTH rule is the general form of the third, and it exists because the third was a list of
 * FILES.** See {@link analyzeFocusScope}: a function that has been handed a pane may not consult
 * the focus in its body — nor reach it through a zero-argument helper — wherever in `src/` it
 * lives. Rule 3 named one module; the pane context bar was in another, and wrote nine controls
 * through `activeTab.value` for a pane it was not drawing.
 *
 * It is the only rule here that parses rather than matches, and it had to become one: a regex over
 * function headers is blind to an arrow with a template-literal body, to a return type containing a
 * brace, and — structurally — to a focus read that is one call away. The table in that docstring
 * lists all eight shapes it used to walk past.
 *
 * **The FIFTH rule is rule 4's mirror, and it exists because the first four all match READS.** See
 * {@link FOCUS_WRITE_RE}: `focusPane` is the only thing that may move the focus, because moving it
 * is four operations and an assignment is one of them.

// ─── Rule 4 · a function given a pane does not consult the focus ──────────────

/**
 * **The general form of rule 3, and the reason rule 3 kept missing things.**
 *
 * Rules 1 and 2 are lists of NAMES; rule 3 is a list of FILES. Each was written after a failure and
 * each was silent about the next one, because per-stage state does not announce itself by name and
 * the modules that hold it are not a fixed set. Four instances landed in one session, all the same
 * shape and none of them catchable:
 *
 * - The Document Header card, drawn for `tab`, mutating `activeTab.value`;
 * - The zoom axis, handed a surface, writing `activeTab.value.session.ui.zoom`;
 * - The debounced Monaco commit, reading one tab's buffer and writing `activeTab.value`;
 * - The whole pane context bar — drawn per pane, from `tabOfPane(paneId)` — writing every one of its
 *   seven axes, its editor picker and its view control through the FOCUSED pane.
 *
 * The rule they all break is one sentence: **a function that has been told which pane it is about
 * does not get to ask which pane has focus.** That is what is checked, and it is checked per
 * FUNCTION rather than per file, because "this module is pane-scoped" is not true of any real
 * module — `panels/stylebook-panel.ts` has one function that takes a surface and another whose
 * subject genuinely is the focused pane, and a file-level rule can only be wrong about one of
 * them.
 *
 * The pane context bar would not have been caught by this on the day it landed, and that is the
 * other half of the fix: every one of those writes went through `store.ts`'s `updateUi(field,
 * value)`, which resolved `activeTab.value` on the caller's behalf. So `store.ts`'s session
 * dispatchers take their target now — there is no `activeTab` in that file — and a pane-scoped
 * caller that wants the focused tab has to spell it, where this rule can see it.
 *
 * **It is an AST check now, and it had to become one.** The first version was a regex over function
 * HEADERS — `\(params\)\s*(:type)?\s*(=>)?\s*\{` — and measured against thirteen hand-written
 * sources it caught four shapes and walked past eight:
 *
 * | missed shape                                               | why the regex could not see it                                   |
 * | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
 * | an arrow whose body is a template literal                  | there is no `{`, so no header matched                            |
 * | ``(paneId) => html`…` ``                                   | same, and it is how half this package renders                    |
 * | a return type containing a brace (`): { a: number } {`)    | the `{` of the TYPE closed the header                            |
 * | a return type that is a function type (`): (x) => void {`) | the `=>` did                                                     |
 * | `Promise<{ … }>`                                           | the brace again, one generic deeper                              |
 * | a parameter named `pane`                                   | the name list held `paneId` only                                 |
 * | a parameter named `container`                              | `paneOfContainer(container)` is the derived route — same promise |
 * | a focus read reached through a HELPER                      | a body-text scan cannot follow a call                            |
 *
 * The last one is the one that mattered: `documentHeaderTemplate(tab, paneId)` called
 * `isPageDocument()`, a zero-argument function whose body read `activeTab.value.documentPath`, and
 * so the Layout picker appeared and vanished in the pane being edited according to the document in
 * the OTHER one. A rule that only reads the body it is standing in cannot say that, however good
 * its regex is, which is why {@link analyzeFocusScope} walks ONE hop of the call graph: a call to a
 * SUBJECT-LESS local function that reads the focus is a focus read at the call site.
 *
 * One hop rather than a transitive closure, deliberately. Two hops reaches `render()`, and from
 * `render()` everything is reachable from everything — the rule would stop naming a defect and
 * start naming the module graph. The exception is a TRANSPARENT FORWARDER — a subject-less helper
 * whose entire body is one call to a reader ({@link forwardedCallees}) — which is charged to its
 * own caller because it adds no meaning of its own: `revealScroller()` was `return
 * getActivePanel()?.scrollContainer ?? null`, and stopping at it named a function nobody wrote a
 * decision in. A forwarder is one frame of stack, not one hop of reasoning.
 *
 * **The second brake used to be ZERO PARAMETERS, and that was the wrong reading of its own
 * rationale.** "A helper that takes a tab has already been told what it is about" is true of a
 * `tab`; it is not true of `(field, entry, value, requiredFields)`. Under the arity brake,
 * `renderFmField` (4 params, seven `activeTab.value` writes) was invisible from the Document Header
 * card that draws it per pane, and so were `applyContentMutation` (2) and `ghostLabel` (2). The
 * brake is now {@link namesItsSubject}: a helper is exempt when its SIGNATURE says which pane or
 * which tab it is about — which is also the reason a pane-scoped helper is charged at its own
 * definition (rule 4 already fires there) rather than at every call site.
 *
 * **`disabledReason` and `isEnabled` are focus reads, and that is the widening §18.4 paid for.** A
 * registry resolves `getContext()` on every predicate evaluation, and that context is built from
 * the FOCUSED pane — so `registry.disabledReason("pane.derive")` asks "is this enabled where the
 * keyboard is", whatever pane the caller was handed. `panels/pane-context.ts`'s preset menu is
 * drawn per pane and asked exactly that: the side pane's rows said "enabled" or "an open document
 * in a pane that is not itself derived" for the same pane, decided by where the author had last
 * clicked.
 *
 * Rule 4 could not see it and **could not be taught to**. The hop is not a call to a local
 * function: it is a method on a VALUE, dispatched by a string id to a closure registered from
 * another module — following it needs type-directed whole-program dataflow through a runtime map,
 * which is a type checker, which is the thing this file exists because we do not have. What CAN be
 * decided from one identifier is that the question was asked at all, and asking it from a
 * pane-scoped function is the defect whether or not the particular command happens to read the
 * focus today. So the NAMES join the list; the closure stays invisible and is not pretended
 * otherwise.

 *
 * - **`src/panels/editors.ts`** — `functionMountWanted(container, tab, editing)` asks
 *   `activeTab.value === tab` on the far side of Monaco's 12.6 MB dynamic import, and it is right
 *   to. Its `container` is the BOTTOM DOCK's, not a pane's stage: the function editor is one
 *   app-level surface that shows the focused document's target by design, so "is this still the tab
 *   the dock is showing" is the whole question. The rule cannot tell a dock container from a stage
 *   container by its name, and widening the name list was worth this one entry — `container` is how
 *   `canvas-surface.ts`'s `paneOfContainer` route is spelled everywhere else.
 * - **`src/settings/css-vars-editor.ts`** — `renderCssVarsEditor(container)` IS drawn in a pane's

 *   is the one-hop rule earning its keep: the SITE half of that push goes to every live host and is
 *   correct, while the STYLEBOOK half composes `activeTab.value?.doc.document?.style` and posts one
 *   result to all specimen canvases — so two panes each showing a stylebook get the focused
 *   document's effective style. Real debt, in `src/style/live-preview.ts` rather than here; the fix
 *   is a per-host post and it is a workstream of its own.
 * - **`src/panels/jump-bar.ts`** — the entry the `disabledReason`/`isEnabled` widening bought, and it
 *   is real debt rather than a false positive. `jumpBarTemplate(paneId)` draws the address of a
 *   NAMED pane and `segmentTpl` renders each crumb disabled-or-not from the registry, so the
 *   unfocused pane's crumbs state the FOCUSED pane's enablement. Today no crumb is visibly wrong —
 *   `pane.pin` scans the grid, `palette.openFiles` and `project.openRecent` are app-level — but
 *   `selection.*` is not, and the shape is the one §18.4's preset menu shipped broken. The fix is
 *   the same one the preset menu took: a pure per-pane predicate per verb, which for the selection

 * are only the direct `f(…)` callees, so a body that computes anything is not a forwarder.
