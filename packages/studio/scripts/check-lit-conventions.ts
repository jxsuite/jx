/**
 * Guard the template layer against the two ways a lit binding stops being the truth.
 *
 * Studio is already a lit app — 92 render roots, `data-jx-region` stamped from templates,
 * `classMap` and `ref` throughout. What it lacked was a rule about where the template's authority
 * ends, and both failures this file checks shipped because of that:
 *
 * - A Spectrum control bound by ATTRIBUTE. `sp-textfield`, `sp-picker` and friends do not reflect
 *   `value` (nor `sp-accordion-item` its `open`), and they mutate that property themselves when the
 *   reader touches them. So lit commits an attribute, the component moves the property, and the
 *   next render carrying the value lit already wrote is dirty-checked away — the write it needed to
 *   make is the one it skips. `.value=${live(x)}` compares against the live property and cannot be
 *   fooled. The bug is invisible: nothing throws, the control simply keeps a value the document
 *   does not have.
 * - A module reaching a node it renders itself, by selector. The node is real until the next render
 *   replaces it, and then the handle is detached or the query finds a sibling pane's copy instead.
 *   `packages/studio/src/panels/target-line.ts` states the rule in its own header — "a module-local
 *   handle rather than a querySelector at call time" — and `ref()` is how you get one.
 *
 * Both rules FAIL BOTH WAYS, in this package's idiom (see `scripts/check-pane-singletons.ts` and
 * `scripts/check-styles.ts`'s ALLOWED_ORPHANS): a new occurrence fails, and an allow-list entry
 * that has been fixed fails too. The lists can only ratchet down, and every entry carries a reason
 * rather than a bare count, because a bare number cannot be told apart from an oversight.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT checked, and why, is {@link EXCLUDED} — the canvas. Those modules are
 * imperative by design, not by neglect, and an allow-list entry is how that gets said out loud
 * instead of looking like a gap.
 *
 * Source-only: no build, no type-checker, runs in about a second. Wired into the CI `checks` job.
