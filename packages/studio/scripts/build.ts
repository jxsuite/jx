/**
 * Build.ts — bundle the studio app with build-time metadata injected.
 *
 * The browser bundle can't read package.json at runtime, so version/build info is injected as
 * compile-time constants (consumed by src/version.ts). After the main bundle, the Monaco web
 * workers are built via build-workers.ts. Desktop's pre-build shells out to `bun run build`, so
 * this injection covers both the dev-server and desktop targets.

/*
 * The two package-root documents, and the manifest.
 *
 * index.html is GENERATED, not authored. It was authored, and so was a copy of it in every host
 * that served the shell — jx-platform rewrote three prefixes and surgically replaced the entry's
 * script tag, and when studio 2.1.0 split the chrome into ./styles/*.css the rewrite list missed it
 * and the cloud shipped seven dead stylesheet links under a green build. The document is now one
 * function of one list, so a stylesheet added to `styles/` and to STUDIO_STYLESHEETS reaches every
 * host at once, and one added to only the first is caught by check-studio-package.ts.
 *
 * canvas.html stays hand-authored: its <style> block establishes the fixed-size query container the
 * runtime transposes viewport units against, and that has to apply before the iframe's first paint.
 *
 * The committed index.html is what the repo dev server serves and what `git diff --exit-code` in
 * the checks job compares against, so writing it here is what keeps the two honest.
