/**
 * Guard the studio UI against hard-coded styling values and undefined CSS classes.
 *
 * The studio drives its styling from Spectrum design tokens (`--spectrum-*`) and a thin studio
 * semantic layer (`--bg`, `--accent`, `--radius`, `--font-mono`, …) declared on the `<sp-theme>`
 * element in `styles/tokens.css`. Raw hex colours bypass that system and stop the UI from
 * responding to the Spectrum theme, so this guard fails (exit 1) when it finds a hard-coded hex
 * that is not:
 *
 * - A fallback inside a token reference: var(--token, #hex)
 * - An explicitly allow-listed brand/structural colour (see ALLOWED_HEX)
 * - A colour _value_ in a data file (colour pickers, the CSS-var editor)
 *
 * It also _warns_ (without failing) on `font-size` / `border-radius` px literals that have an exact
 * Spectrum token equivalent, to nudge new code toward tokens. Spacing, structural dimensions,
 * z-index, and rgba() shadow/scrim values are intentionally not policed — Spectrum's scale is
 * coarse and a dense editor UI legitimately uses off-grid structural px. See STYLING.md for the
 * full policy.
 *
 * The second rule is the mirror image: a class name emitted by a `src/**` template that no
 * stylesheet in the package defines. An orphan class is a surface that opted out of the design
 * system — it is invariably being held together by inline `style=` attributes instead, which is how
 * half the app drifted away from the tokens in the first place. See ALLOWED_ORPHANS.
 *
 * The third rule is the FOCUS RING. UX-REDESIGN-PLAN §12 P0 workstream 7 replaced eight bare
 * `outline: none` declarations with `:focus-visible` pairs and promised "a stylelint rule bans bare
 * `outline: none`" — the sweep landed and the rule never did, so the next `outline: none` would
 * have gone in unremarked and taken a control off the keyboard with it. A ban alone would have been
 * the weaker gate, because the defect is not the suppression: it is a suppression whose RESTORE is
 * missing. So each allowance names the `:focus-visible` rule that puts the ring back, and the check
 * verifies that rule still exists and still sets an outline — deleting the restore turns the
 * allowance red at the line the suppression is on. See FOCUS_RING_ALLOWANCES.
 *
 * The fourth and fifth rules are about SILENCE rather than styling, and they live here because this
 * file is the package's idiom for "a wide, shallow property with a ratcheting allow-list" — the
 * shape UX-REDESIGN-PLAN §7.1 asks for by name:
 *
 * - **`statusMessage` is banned from `src/`.** It is deleted: 78 call sites — 26 failures and 52
 *   successes — printed the same 11px grey line and erased it after three seconds. Outcomes go to
 *   `services/notify.ts` (`notify.success/warn/error`), whose tier is chosen by the action the
 *   outcome requires. Without a mechanical guard a wide, shallow change like that silently regrows,
 *   one convenient call at a time; the rule has no allow-list because there is nothing to allow.
 * - **A bare empty `catch` is banned from `src/`.** 158 of 240 catch blocks reached no surface at all
 *   and 46 were entirely empty. A block with no statements AND no comment says nothing about
 *   whether the silence was decided or forgotten — so it must either notify, or carry an explicit
 *   `// intentionally ignored: <reason>`. SILENT_CATCH_BUDGET is the shrinking backlog, per file,
 *   and it fails BOTH ways: a new one fails, and a stale count fails too.
 *
 * Run: bun run scripts/check-styles.ts (also wired into `bun test` via package.json)
