/**
 * The lens/companion mutation gate — prove the derived-pane tests can tell right from wrong.
 *
 * **Why a mutation gate and not more tests.** Three review rounds each found ~10 defects in the
 * derived pane (§18.4) and each fixed the named ones. The third measured why: it flipped the
 * workstream's lens/companion discriminators one at a time, and seven behaviours turned out to be
 * indistinguishable from their opposite across eight thousand tests. This file is the standing
 * version of that measurement: a table of mutants, each with the ONE test file expected to catch
 * it, run for real. A mutant that survives is a red gate naming the behaviour that is unprotected.
 *
 * **The table is built by walking the DIFF, not by walking the fixes — and that is the whole of
 * round four's finding.** The previous table had 51 rows and was assembled from the defects each
 * round had repaired, which is a list of what somebody already thought about. An independent
 * enumeration of the workstream's diff found 32 discriminators the table did not name; eleven of
 * them, applied one at a time against a 101-file union of 3015 tests, killed nothing at all. Three
 * were `void` render-input reads whose siblings ONE LINE AWAY were in the table. Two were the
 * second half of an invariant the table protected only the first half of. Six whole modules in the
 * diff had no entry of any kind. A table of remembered defects will always have that shape; a table
 * walked from the diff can be checked.
 *
 * **How to repeat the enumeration.** From `packages/studio`:
 *
 *     { git diff -U0 -- src styles | grep '^+' | grep -v '^+++'
 *       sed 's/^/+/' src/workspace/pane-derive.ts; }              # …and any other untracked file
 *     | grep -vE '^\+\s*(\*|/\*|//)'                              # drop comments
 *     | grep -E 'derived|derivation|sourcePaneId|paneId|pane\.id|\blens\b|companion|preset|
 *                activePaneId|PRIMARY_PANE|SECONDARY_PANE|OfPane\(|paneOfTab|paneById|\bpanes\b'
 *
 * That is ~400 added lines. A line is a DISCRIMINATOR when it CHOOSES — a condition, a ternary, a
 * filter predicate, a pane-scoped resolution, a `void` read that exists to establish tracking. An
 * import, a type, an object-literal key, a bare accessor and a re-export choose nothing and get no
 * row; neither does a line whose inversion no state the app can reach could observe, which is dead
 * code rather than a defect (see the note below on the diff seed). Everything left is the table
 * below — grouped by file in the diff's own order — so the next reader can re-run the command and
 * check the result against the ids here. **The gate prints its own denominator**: how many
 * discriminators it measures, how they were enumerated, and what it deliberately does not measure —
 * see {@link printBoundary} and {@link OUTSIDE_THE_TABLE}. A kill count with no denominator reads
 * as "everything", and the honest denominator is "the behaviours somebody wrote a row for".
 *
 * **It fails both ways.** A `find` string that no longer appears — or appears twice — fails just as
 * loudly as a surviving mutant, because a mutant that cannot be applied is a mutant that proves
 * nothing. Renaming a discriminator therefore means visiting this file, which is the point: the
 * entry says in one sentence what goes wrong if the line is wrong, and that sentence is the only
 * place several of these behaviours are written down at all. **An exclusion carries a `find` too**
 * — round four's other finding. Both `browserOnly` rows had `edits: []`, so `.tab-derivation` could
 * be renamed out of existence and they would print green forever: notes wearing a mutant's clothes.
 * An excluded row's edit is never RUN, but its `find` is resolved with every other row's, before
 * anything is executed. One of the two is gone entirely — it named "a breakpoint lens's artboard is
 * fitted to its own pane", which has no implementing line separate from `fitKey`'s lens suffix and
 * `zoomOf`, both of which are in the table and killed. A row pointing at nothing is worse than no
 * row: it reads like coverage.
 *
 * **The exclusion list is now EMPTY, and that is round five's finding.** `browserOnly` still
 * exists, because a claim about a computed HEIGHT genuinely cannot be killed by a unit test —
 * happy-dom lays nothing out and every rect is 0×0. But the one row still carrying it was excluded
 * for the wrong noun: its reason was true of the height and the mutant edited the DECLARATION, and
 * happy-dom resolves the CASCADE perfectly well. `getComputedStyle` on an element in the document
 * returns the padding and border a stylesheet gave it, so `lens-chrome.test.ts` reads `shell.css`
 * off disk, renders the chip `derivationChipTpl` emits beside the chip `tabChip` emits, and
 * compares the two boxes — which also closes the rename hole the `find` could not: rename
 * `.tab-derivation` in all four of its places and the `find` still matches once, while the test
 * goes red. An exclusion is available for the next honest one; there is none today. What remains
 * uncovered by any unit test is the resulting GEOMETRY, and {@link OUTSIDE_THE_TABLE} says so in
 * the gate's own output rather than in a row that cannot fail.
 *
 * **What is deliberately NOT here.** A mutation nothing can observe is not a defect, it is dead
 * code, and a table entry for one would be a test of a fact the app does not have. `derivationFor`
 * seeding a fresh diff lens from `shell.git.diffState` was exactly that once `applyDerivation`
 * learned to clear a comparison that is not the source document's: the seed is overwritten inside
 * the same synchronous `run`, before any frame. It is written as `null` because that is the honest
 * value, and the CLEAR carries the behaviour and the mutant.
 *
 * Round four found six more of that shape and DELETED them rather than giving them rows, which is
 * the only honest way to answer "no test can tell": a second `_diffLoads.delete` reachable only
 * through a writer that already forgets; a `hit.layoutFile === path` guard whose false branch the
 * line above it makes unreachable; a `surfacesShowingTab(tab).length > 0` guard in front of a call
 * `classifyOps` has already gated in the same statement sequence; and — the largest, nine lines
 * across two panels — every `void pane.derived?.…` render-input read in `tab-strip.ts` and
 * `pane-context.ts`. Those two effects call `render()` synchronously, so the values their templates
 * read are already dependencies; the `void` lines restated them and could each be inverted with
 * nothing in the suite able to notice. `studio.ts`'s look identical and are NOT dead — that effect
 * calls `scheduleCanvasRender`, and `renderCanvasImpl` runs in a rAF, outside the tracking. Four of
 * them are in the table and all four die.
 *
 * Runs from `packages/studio`. One test FILE per mutant, not the suite, plus one baseline run per
 * distinct file — it belongs in the `checks` job beside `check-pane-singletons.ts`, not in the
 * per-workspace matrix.
 *
 * **If this process is killed with `SIGKILL`** it leaves at most ONE file mutated on disk: the one
 * named in the last `✓`/`✗`/`?` line it printed. `git diff` shows the injected edit and `git
 * checkout -- <that file>` removes it. Every other exit — a throw, a failed `expect`, a Ctrl-C —
 * restores in a `finally`; see {@link runMutant} and {@link main}.

     THE LAST EXCLUSION, AND IT WAS WRONG. This row carried `browserOnly` with the reason "a
     one-chip strip keeping the tab row's height is a COMPUTED-HEIGHT claim, and happy-dom lays
     nothing out". Every word of that is true of the HEIGHT and none of it is true of the
     DECLARATION the mutant edits: happy-dom resolves the CASCADE, so `getComputedStyle` on an
     element in the document returns the padding and border a stylesheet gave it, and the padding is
     what the height rests on. The reason was about the wrong noun.
     The exclusion also could not go red on a rename, which is the failure mode an exclusion is
     supposed to be protected from: rename `.tab-derivation` in all four of its places and the
     `find` below still matches once, because it names neither the class nor the file's structure.
     `lens-chrome.test.ts` closes both ends — it reads the stylesheet from disk, renders the chip
     `derivationChipTpl` actually emits beside the chip `tabChip` emits, and compares the two boxes
     against each other. A rename on either side fails it; so does a stylesheet that did not load.
     The height itself is still nobody's here: it belongs to `packages/studio:verify` and a
     screenshot, and shell.css says so at the rule.
     **This list is now empty.** An honest exclusion is still available — see {@link Mutant.browserOnly} —
     but every claim in the table is executed. */
