/**
 * The lock on the door `NAVIGATOR_PANEL_IDS` describes (src/shell.ts).
 *
 * `shell.leftTab` is a `string` because it is also read back from state an older build persisted,
 * and {@link migratePanelId} is what translates one of those. What had no answer was the WRITE
 * path: `setActivityTab` took a `string`, so the Outline's empty state could call it with
 * `"blocks"` — a panel since renamed to `insert` — and the Navigator would land on `unknownPanel`'s
 * dead body reading "No Navigator panel is registered as blocks". Three phases, 8,311 passing
 * tests, six green gates, and a control whose one job was to open a panel.
 *
 * The fix is a type: `setActivityTab(tab: NavigatorPanelId)`. That leaves exactly one gap the type
 * cannot close — an id arriving from `PanelRecord.id`, which is deliberately a `string` because the
 * same registry hosts the Bottom dock's panels — and {@link requireNavigatorPanelId} is the single
 * lock both of those callers (the rail's buttons, ⌘1–8's dispatcher) share.
