/**
 * The guards and the ordering rules of the pane model that nothing else reaches (B3): `addPane`'s
 * "the id is already in the grid" answer, `closePane`'s "that pane is not here", `insertIntoPane`'s
 * idempotence and the pinned prefix it inserts against, `document.setPinned`'s idempotent write,
 * `pane.pin` run past its own gate, and a stored view-settings entry that is not an object.
 *
 * Every one of them is a refusal rather than an action, so each test asserts the state that did NOT
 * change beside the one that did — a refusal nothing can distinguish from the act it refuses is not
 * a refusal.
