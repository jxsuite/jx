 * "Does this file's markup have a stylesheet?" — the orphan rule of `scripts/check-styles.ts`,

 *
 * The gate itself reports a count over `src/**` and a ratcheting allow-list, which is the right
 * shape for CI and the wrong shape for a panel's own test file: it cannot say _which_ surface
 * regressed, and it stays green while a specific panel goes back to inline `style=` attributes as
 * long as the new name is added to the list. A per-file question fails in the PR that reintroduces
 * it, names the class, and needs no allow-list of its own.
 *
 * Both extractors are the gate's, so "emitted" and "defined" mean exactly what CI means by them.
