/**
 * The reference count inside every delete and rename confirmation.
 *
 * This is the point of the whole usage query: before this, deleting a component used on seven pages
 * and deleting an unused one produced the identical dialog. The assertions below are about what the
 * dialog SAYS — that a delete and a rename say different things about the same number, and that a
 * host which cannot count says nothing at all rather than implying zero.
 *
 * The **media** section is about a number the dialog once got wrong. A media file's authored
 * reference usually resolves to a path that is not the file — `/hero.jpg` for `public/hero.jpg`,
 * the asset mount for an asset inside a collection — and a query that could not see those returned
 * a confident zero for uses that are really there. Studio used to compensate by asking about every
 * authored spelling and unioning the answers; the ENGINE resolves those lanes now
 * (`site-architecture.md` §9.3), so the dialog asks once, about the file.
 *
 * The query log is still asserted, and now for the opposite reason. It used to prove the dialog
 * asked enough questions; it proves it asks exactly ONE, because a second question here would be a
 * second implementation of a rule the engine owns — and the client copy is the one that cannot fix
 * the rewrite. Which lanes the engine finds is asserted where the resolution lives:
 * `packages/server/tests/refactor-find-refs.test.ts` and `refactor-parity.test.ts`.
