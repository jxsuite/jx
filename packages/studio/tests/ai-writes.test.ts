/**
 * Tests for src/services/ai-writes.ts — the per-turn record of what the assistant changed (§7.4).
 *
 * The two facts under test are the two the panel could not previously state: WHICH files a turn
 * changed, and which of those changes undo can reach. The second is the load-bearing one — document
 * tools go through `transactDoc`, `write_file` goes straight to disk, and the caveat used to be
 * appended to the MODEL-facing tool summary rather than shown to the person holding ⌘Z.
