/**
 * The shell's mount tree (src/shell/tree.ts) — the one definition of the application frame.
 *
 * It was index.html's body, and, in drifted copies, the body of two dozen test fixtures. The copy
 * in `studio-shell-fixture.ts` had lost `#resize-bottom`, `#bottom-dock` and `#layer-toast`, so
 * every shell-boot test sharing it ran against a shell with no bottom dock and no toast host — and
 * no test could report that, because the fixture WAS the thing under test. These assertions are the
 * ones that could not exist while the frame was markup two dozen files each described for
 * themselves.
