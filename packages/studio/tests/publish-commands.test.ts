/**
 * `Publish:` family tests — the three records' gates, and `runDeploy` as an Activity.
 *
 * Two things are asserted that are easy to get wrong and invisible when they are:
 *
 * - A deploy failure raises exactly ONE report, from `activity.fail`, and the caller does not also
 *   notify (§16 — a Problem and a toast for one failure is the double-reporting the tier system
 *   exists to prevent);
 * - The activity ENDS in every branch, including the one where Cloudflare answers nothing. A running
 *   activity is an idle blocker (`services/idle.ts`), so an operation that forgets to finish hangs
 *   `probe.idle()` and every screenshot after it.
