/**
 * The canvas half of `probe.idle()`, and the point resolution that replaced a coordinate guess.
 *
 * Two questions the parent realm could not previously answer about a cross-origin canvas:
 *
 * 1. _Has it settled?_ — answered by the frame itself (`{kind: "idle"}`), folded in PER HOST so P8's
 *    second pane does not turn `shot.ts`'s "Studio's only child frame" into a coin flip.
 * 2. _Where is this node on screen?_ — answered by the host composing its own transforms, which is
 *    what deletes the caller's `Math.abs(scale - 1) < 0.001` branch.
