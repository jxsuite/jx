/**
 * Two live canvas hosts, one in each pane — the two claims the whole workstream is for.
 *
 * Everything below the grid landed one pane at a time and was true at one pane by inspection. These
 * two are only true with a SECOND live host, and nothing had ever run with one:
 *
 * 1. **One preparation, two posts.** A render pass resolves the document ONCE and fans the result out
 *    to every artboard in that pass — and to no artboard outside it. `preparePassRender` caches on
 *    `(gen, doc)`, and the generations are per-surface now, so the cache key is the thing most
 *    likely to have broken when the second stage arrived: a shared counter would have made pane A's
 *    pass and pane B's collide, and a per-pane counter that reused NUMBERS would have made them
 *    share a cache entry across two different documents.
 * 2. **Unsplit actually releases.** Not that a variable was nulled — that the frames were disposed,
 *    the artboards' reactive scopes were stopped, and the pane's surface record is gone.
 *    `releaseCanvasHosts` returns a count; the count is the assertion.
 *
 * Driven through `panels/pane-grid.ts` rather than against hand-built divs, because the thing under
 * test is the cell lifecycle: a pane appears, mounts frames, and goes away.
