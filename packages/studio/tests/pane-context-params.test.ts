/**
 * The context bar's route-param pickers, with TWO panes attached.
 *
 * One claim, and it is a liveness claim rather than a rendering one. The candidate values behind
 * `resolving with [sku] ⌄` were cached in a single slot (`_paramValues` + `_paramValuesKey`) while
 * `render()` loops every attached pane. Two panes showing pages under DIFFERENT dynamic routes
 * evicted each other on every pass — and because the load that landed called `render()`, which
 * re-issued both loads, the result was an unbounded microtask chain: no animation frame, no paint,
 * no keystroke. `⌘\` with two dynamic pages open was the whole reproduction.
 *
 * It cannot be caught by a one-pane test, by the type checker or by any lint rule: a `let` holding
 * one value is perfectly well-typed and perfectly correct until there are two of the thing.
 *
 * The mocked loader CAPS itself. Without the fix the chain never yields, so `await flush()` would
 * never resume and this file would hang rather than go red — the cap turns a hang into a failed
 * expectation, which is a test result somebody can read.
