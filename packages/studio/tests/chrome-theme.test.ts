/**
 * The chrome theme, end to end — Preferences → Appearance → Light used to be a setting that did
 * nothing, and this file is the three-part reason it could.
 *
 * 1. `<sp-theme>` adopts the colour fragment REGISTERED UNDER the `color` it is given, and adopts none
 *    at all for a name it does not know. Only "dark" was registered, so `color="light"` was a valid
 *    attribute over an empty palette: every `--spectrum-*` colour token went undefined, the studio
 *    semantic layer fell through to its dark hex fallbacks, and the chrome did not move. So the
 *    first test counts the ADOPTED FRAGMENTS per declared theme — the observable that was wrong —
 *    and pins an unregistered Spectrum colour as the negative control, because an assertion about a
 *    registry that cannot fail is not a test.
 * 2. The Jx brand fragment re-values the palette and is adopted for EVERY colour, so a stop it
 *    overrides in one ramp and forgets in the other silently paints the wrong theme's brand value.
 *    The second test holds the two ramps to the same stop set.
 * 3. Monaco paints from its own registry and cannot read a CSS custom property, so it is the one
 *    surface the Spectrum theme does not reach: both editors were created with a literal "vs-dark".
 *    The rest of the file covers the projection that now carries the record to it.
