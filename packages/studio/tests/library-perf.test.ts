/**
 * The P7.1 acceptance case, as a test: a 300-page project opening the Library's "All" category.
 *
 * The Manage view this replaces rendered one card per file with NO cap, and each page/layout/
 * component/content card mounted a real `@jxsuite/runtime` render of that document into an
 * unbounded `Map`. Three hundred pages therefore meant three hundred live documents built in one
 * synchronous pass and retained until the tab closed.
 *
 * The baseline is measured, not remembered. `computeWindow` answers "the whole list" for an
 * unmeasured scroller (a pane that has not been laid out), so the first paint here IS the old
 * behaviour, taken through the same code. The measurement then stubs the scroller's box — the one
 * thing happy-dom does not supply — and repaints, and the two numbers are printed side by side.
 *
 * The assertions are ratios and caps, never wall-clock times: a timing threshold in CI measures the
 * runner's mood. The timings are PRINTED so a regression is visible to a reader without being a
 * flake for everyone else.
