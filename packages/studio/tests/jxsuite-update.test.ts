/**
 * Src/packages/jxsuite-update.ts — the on-open @jxsuite update prompt.

 * The behaviour under test CHANGED: the target is each package's own newest published version, read
 * from the registry through `platform.packageVersions()`, not the version this Studio build embeds.
 * So the cases that matter are the ones a suite-wide target got wrong — packages on different
 * versions, a package with no newer publish, and a project pinned ahead of the registry.
