/**
 * Diff-gap tests for the settings surfaces and the two services beside them.
 *
 * Each block covers a branch the sibling suites reach around rather than through: a store that is
 * not there, a lazy import that refuses, a control that parked its own failure, the pane host's two
 * draw guards, and the one thing `write_file` cannot pre-validate — the disk saying no.
 *
 * `section-registry` is mocked for two of them, and only two of its exports are replaced:
 *
 * - `setSettingsSection` throws, which is what a failed chunk load looks like to the CSS-variables
 *   editor's "Manage contexts…" — the module imports the registry LAZILY to break a cycle, so the
 *   only thing that can go wrong is asynchronous and its `.catch` is the only place that says so.
 * - `onSettingsDocumentChanged` hands the listener to the test and returns an unsubscribe that does
 *   nothing, so a change notification can be delivered to a pane that has already been detached.
 *   The real unsubscribe makes that state unreachable; the guard in `draw` is what would catch it
 *   if it ever became reachable again, and this is the only way to prove it still holds.
 *
 * Everything else is the real module, spread through — the registry's `sections` map is shared, so
 * a section registered here is the section the pane host renders.
