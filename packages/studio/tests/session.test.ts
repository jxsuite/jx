/**
 * The session a project is left in, and the one it comes back as (plan §4.4).
 *
 * Every case here is about a claim the app made and did not keep: the per-project record's own
 * interface said "session state grows into this shape" while holding two layout fields, so
 * reopening a project landed on the home page with an empty strip — and P3's "Newly possible" says
 * "the session survives a relaunch".
 *
 * The validation cases matter as much as the round trip. `localStorage` is hand-editable and
 * outlives the version that wrote it, so every field read back is input.
