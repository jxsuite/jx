/**
 * One `mock.module` factory for `services/notify.ts`, for the tests that want to assert on the
 * SENTENCE a module reports rather than on the store it lands in.
 *
 * It spreads the real module and overrides only `notify`, which matters: `surfaces/statusbar.ts`
 * imports `problems` and `problemCount` from the same module, so a factory that returned four
 * functions and nothing else would break every importer in the graph — the failure mode that made
 * this helper worth writing down once.
 *
 * Prefer the real store where you can (`toasts`, `problems`, `resetNotifications`); reach for this
 * only when the module under test is mocked at the boundary anyway.
