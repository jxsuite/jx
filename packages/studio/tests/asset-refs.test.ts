/**
 * Asset resolution for the canvas.

 * The `"site"` block below is a CHARACTERISATION suite, carried over from `content-assets.test.ts`
 * unchanged in what it asserts: `"site"` is what desktop and `jx dev` have always done, so every
 * one of these answers must survive the rebuild byte for byte. It is expressed against
 * `resolveAssetRef` rather than against the document walk it used to run through, because the walk
 * is gone — a walk sees only LITERAL values, and the canvas now resolves every reference at render
 * time, bound ones included. The rules mirror `rewriteEntryAssets` in
 * extensions/parser/src/content-loader.ts, and the cases are written against the CONTRACT (relative
 * and inside the collection → mounted; everything else untouched) so a divergence shows up here.
 *
 * The `"repo"` block is the new space — a host that serves PROJECT PATHS because nothing answers a
 * site URL on its origin.
