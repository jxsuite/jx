/**
 * Every command factory in `src/` is composed into `appCommandSet()`.
 *
 * Twice now a phase of the shell redesign has defined command records, tested them, and shipped
 * them unreachable. The feedback phase left `help.about` out; the content phase left FOURTEEN out —
 * `sourceControlCommands`, `publishCommands`, `gridViewCommands` and `redirectsCommands` — so Push,
 * Deploy, Save View and the whole Redirects editor were absent from the palette with no other entry
 * point, while their own unit tests passed and `check-command-levels` reported a healthy number of
 * the records it COULD see.
 *
 * It is a structural hazard, not carelessness: a record is registered in the module that owns it,
 * and `commands/app-commands.ts` is the one shared file no workstream owns. Nothing failed, because
 * a command that is never composed is simply absent — and absence is what every other check reads
 * as "fine".
 *
 * So the guard is mechanical. Any `export function …Commands(): AnyCommand[]` under `src/` is a
 * contribution point by construction, and must appear in the composition. Adding a factory and
 * forgetting to spread it now fails here, naming the factory and the file.
