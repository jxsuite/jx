 * origin). happy-dom takes that literally and issues an HTTP request, which fails with ECONNREFUSED
 * because no dev server runs under `bun test`. Nothing awaits those requests, so the rejections sat
 * unobserved — until a test yielded to the event loop long enough (awaiting a
 * `requestAnimationFrame`, say) for one to surface as an unhandled rejection and take the whole test
 * file down with it. The canvas bridge is exercised through `fakeChannelPair`, never through a real
 * page load, so the fetch was never wanted here.
