/**
 * What a LENS pane's chrome says, and what it deliberately does not offer.
 *
 * Presence and identity only. Every geometric claim about this surface — that the `⟲` trigger fits
 * the bar's leading slot at the splitter's 320px floor without pushing the three axes into a second
 * row, that the one-chip strip does not collapse to zero height, that the preset popover's
 * `bottom-end` placement does not open off the left edge in the primary pane, that the breakpoint
 * lens's artboard is fitted to its own pane — is a LAYOUT claim, and happy-dom does no layout:
 * every rect here is zero. Those belong to `packages/studio:verify` plus a screenshot, and are
 * named here rather than asserted, because an assertion that cannot fail is worse than no test at
 * all. Two CSS grid bugs shipped green through 8000 tests last round and were found by opening a
 * picture.
 *
 * What CAN fail here is the set of controls: a lens must not offer the two axes that WRITE
 * (`ctx.setCanvasMode(tab, …)` on a tab the pane beside it owns), must not draw the Document Header
 * card (an editing surface over the same frontmatter), must keep the zoom pod (zoom is the one view
 * fact a lens owns), and must draw a derivation chip where an ordinary pane draws tab chips.
