 * The app's whole command set, as the browserless CI checks read it.
 *
 * `src/commands/app-commands.ts` exists so `check-command-levels`, `check-chrome-budget` and
 * `check-shot-contract` can see the records that live beside their implementations rather than in
 * `commands/defaults.ts`. Two properties make that work, and both are asserted here: the set is
 * internally consistent (no duplicate ids, no misplacements, no toggles, no chord conflicts), and
 * the module loads in a BARE Bun process. The second is the fragile one — a `document` read added
 * at module scope anywhere in the import graph would break Lane 1 in CI with a stack trace nobody
 * would connect to this file, so the subprocess test below fails here instead.
