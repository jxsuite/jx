/**
 * `selection.repeat`'s converter, doubled — the one command record in this set whose `run` reaches
 * outside this module's graph.
 *
 * Two reasons, and the second is not about this file at all.
 *
 * It makes the test below ASSERT something. `defaults.ts` fires the converter as `void
 * import("../editor/convert-to-repeater").then(...)`, a promise nothing can await: the `await
 * registry.run(...)` below returns while it is still in flight, so before this double existed the
 * test ran the command and observed nothing whatever. A specifier typo would have sailed through
 * it. The double is what makes "runs the converter" a claim with a witness.
 *
 * And it keeps the converter's COVERAGE. Bun 1.4.0 loses a source file's coverage record entirely
 * when two or more dynamic `import()`s of it are in flight AT ONCE — the module still evaluates and
 * its exports still work, only the record goes (jxsuite/jx#240;
 * `scripts/repro/bun-coverage-drop.sh` shows it in four files with no jx code). The two `run()`
 * calls below did exactly that: the first floating import had not settled when the second started.
 * This file was the only one still letting real imports of the converter overlap — its siblings
 * `context-menu.test.ts` and `settings-key-scope.test.ts` already double it — and the file that
 * then loads the converter for real is a different one, whose `readdir` position decides whether it
 * runs before or after. That is why the same tree flipped between recording and not with no change
 * to any code, and why it read as a CI-only defect for weeks.
 *
 * Removing this double is therefore not a style choice. It deletes an assertion and re-arms a
 * coverage drop that `scripts/check-coverage-manifest.ts` then has to spend a second pass proving.
