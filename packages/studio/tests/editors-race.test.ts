/**
 * ⑪ · Logic — what happens INSIDE the Monaco load.
 *
 * `tests/editors.test.ts` drives the code surface the way the dock does and awaits `loadMonaco()`
 * before it asserts, which is right for every question it asks and blind to the only question this
 * file asks: what if the user acts while the load is still in flight? Monaco is 12.6 MB behind a
 * cold dynamic import — hundreds of milliseconds during which Close, a retarget and a second dock
 * repaint are all ordinary things to do — and coverage cannot see an interleaving, so that window
 * read as 100% covered while leaking a live editor on three separate paths.
 *
 * So `loadMonaco` is mocked with a GATE this file opens by hand. Every test starts a mount, does
 * something to the surface while it is suspended, and then lets the import land.
