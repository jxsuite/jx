/**
 * Boot with a panel id that MOVED DOCKS (src/shell.ts).
 *
 * The fourth boot case, and a different failure from `shell-boot-panel-migration`'s rename. §16.3
 * settled Problems into the Bottom dock, so `"problems"` is no longer a Navigator panel under any
 * name — there is nothing to alias it to. A build from before that correction can still have
 * written `leftTab: "problems"` to this machine, and the only honest outcome is the default panel:
 * the Navigator cannot show a Bottom dock tab, and a Navigator that comes up empty saying "no panel
 * is registered as problems" is the wedge {@link migratePanelId} exists to prevent.
 *
 * The Bottom dock is unaffected — its own `bottomTab` already defaults to Problems — so the list
 * the user was looking at is one ⌘4 away, not gone.
