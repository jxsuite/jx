/**
 * Nothing in `packages/studio/src` may be unreachable from the app's entry points.
 *
 * P7 shipped ELEVEN features that were built, unit-tested, and reachable from nothing — four
 * command factories neither composed nor registered, two composed but never registered, and four
 * functions (`applyDraftFilter`, `loadMediaUsages`, `peekMediaUsages`, `mediaUsageHeadline`) with
 * no caller at all. Every gate was green, because a unit test imports the module under test
 * directly and so cannot tell whether anything else does. `tests/app-commands-composition.test.ts`
 * closed the command-factory half of that by pattern; this closes the rest by construction.
 *
 * Three of that original four are now wired: the media viewer (`media/media-pane.ts`) is the
 * surface `peekMediaUsages` and `mediaUsageHeadline` were written for, and it reads `loadMediaMeta`
 * for the size and dimensions it shows. `site-architecture.md` §9.4 had listed the missing reader
 * as a known gap for as long as they sat here — the ledger and the spec were saying the same thing
 * in two places, and both stop saying it in the same change.
 *
 * The analysis is in `./reachability.ts` — a call graph over the TypeScript checker's own symbol
 * resolution, walked from the bundle entrypoints, the package's published exports, and the repo
 * scripts that import studio source. Tests are not roots, which is the entire point.
 *
 * Two lists, and they are different things:
 *
 * - {@link DYNAMIC_ENTRY} — genuinely reached, through a channel no static analysis can see. These
 *   are NOT debt; deleting one turns a green CI lane red. Each says who reaches it and how.
 * - {@link KNOWN_UNREACHABLE} — the functions the running app still cannot get to. A debt ledger, not
 *   a set of exemptions: it only ever shrinks, and **every entry carries a reason**. It landed
 *   holding 143 bare names across 91 files, which is how nine `deploy-checklist.ts` lines hid a
 *   FINISHED feature nobody had plugged in — a bare name cannot be told apart from an oversight.
 *   Triaging those 143 resolved 29 of them (two whole modules and the legacy flat-state layer
 *   deleted; six caches, accessors and a delegation wired) and gave the remaining 114 a stated
 *   decision. Delete the code with its tests, or give it an entry point, and delete the line.
 *
 * All three gates below are staleness-tested, so none can rot into a suppression: a name that no
 * longer exists fails, a name that became reachable fails, and an entry with no reason fails.
 *
 * Runtime is about 5s: one type-check of the monorepo, then batched symbol resolution.
