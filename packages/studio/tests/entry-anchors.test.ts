/**
 * The `import.meta.url` rule — the durable half of the bundle-base fix.
 *
 * The bug it guards is not a bug in any expression; it is a bug in WHERE an expression sits. `new
 * URL("workers/…", import.meta.url)` was correct when `services/monaco-setup` was part of the
 * entry, and became wrong the moment `splitting: true` hoisted it into
 * `dist/chunks/monaco-setup-<hash>.js`. Nothing failed, nothing logged: Monaco's workers 404'd and
 * the JSON language service simply stopped existing.
 *
 * So the rule is structural rather than behavioural — only an ENTRY may consult its own url, and
 * every other module goes through `services/bundle-base`. A source assertion is the right shape
 * here: it needs no build, it survives the next refactor that moves a module between chunks, and it
 * fails in the pull request that reintroduces the hazard rather than in a browser nobody is
 * watching.
 *
 * Fails BOTH ways, in this package's idiom (`scripts/check-pane-singletons.ts`): a new
 * `import.meta.url` outside the allow-list fails, and an entry that stops anchoring fails too.
