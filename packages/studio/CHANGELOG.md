# Changelog

## [5.0.0](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/compare/studio-v4.1.0...studio-v5.0.0) (2026-09-06)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **runtime,compiler,site,studio:** `@jxsuite/runtime` no longer writes authored declarations to `el.style`, so code reading them back off an element after `applyStyle` sees nothing. The `elementStyleTags` export is replaced by `releaseElementStyles` and `resetDocumentStyles`, which refcount a shared rule set rather than handing out an element to remove by hand; `documentStyleText` reads back what was written.

### Features

* popovers become a first-class thing the canvas can open, and a rule it can check ([bf757f1](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/bf757f1c9a9d94e15cbaac3be5405588c082cee3))

* **studio:** the Edit canvas resizes by dragging, and the breakpoint follows the width ([d31e301](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/d31e301d04750cc63b90f4855b829db2ddc80295))

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **studio,desktop:** StudioPlatform's `saveSettings` is replaced by `patchSettings`, which takes a set/remove patch and answers with the resulting store. It stays optional, so an adapter that implements neither degrades to cache-only rather than throwing.

* **studio:** a translated entry has a mount, and one predicate decides a media field ([eb55d84](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/eb55d84bb9ae8714144d35d4971a253ec3ff333c))
* **studio:** keep the canvas iframe out of the editor shell ([2a1818b](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/2a1818b2e4fa922555d2f236c867584d2adf8e24))
