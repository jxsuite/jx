 *
 * An OPEN popover is in the top layer, and CSS Position 4 §3.1 gives a top-layer element the
 * VIEWPORT as its containing block whatever its ancestors say. In the editor canvas that viewport
 * is a fiction: the frame is sized to its own content height, so a drawer pinned with `inset: 0`
 * lands halfway down a 6000px page, and a panel taller than a short component frame is clipped by
 * the `overflow: hidden` the canvas document needs. Worse, a top-layer box contributes nothing to
 * any ancestor's scrollable overflow, so the artboard can never grow to fit one.
 *
 * When this is on, the runtime stamps `popover` on `data-jx-popover` for nodes the studio can
 * ADDRESS — those carrying a stamped `data-jx-path`. That drops every `[popover]` UA rule at once,
 * and the one that matters most is `position: fixed`: with it gone the panel lays out in NORMAL
 * FLOW at its document position, which is what makes it contribute to `#jx-canvas-root`'s
 * scrollHeight so the host can grow the artboard to fit it. Leaving the top layer is necessary but
 * not sufficient — a fixed box contributes nothing to an ancestor's overflow either.
 *
 * It is worth saying what does NOT rescue this, because it is the intuitive answer and it is wrong:
 * `container-type: size` on the canvas's query container does NOT make it a containing block for
 * fixed descendants. Measured in Chrome 151 — `getComputedStyle(container).contain` is `none`, and
 * a `position: fixed` child inside it measures the WINDOW, not the container. So a panel that stays
 * fixed stays laid out against the frame's own viewport, which in an editable mode is the
 * document's full height. `iframe-render.ts` therefore FORCES `position` on the open panel rather
 * than relying on any containment.
 *
 * The studio re-supplies the one UA rule that matters — `display: none` while closed — inside a
 * cascade LAYER, so author declarations still beat it exactly as they beat the real UA rule on the
 * shipped page. That is deliberate: a popover whose base rule sets `display` is broken in
 * production, and the canvas has to show that rather than paper over it.
 *
 * The gate on `data-jx-path` is what keeps this out of documents the studio does not own: a popover
 * rendered inside a component's own template is never stamped, so it keeps its native behaviour.
 *
 * It also drives {@link transposeCanvasPopoverSelector}. The two are one transform — an attribute
 * renamed without its selectors transposed is a popover that can never be styled open.

/*
 * ─── The Stylesheet Engine ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * An authored `style` object becomes REAL CSS RULES, delivered through the document's
 * `adoptedStyleSheets`. Everything below exists to make that true, and the reason it has to be
 * true is a cascade inversion rather than a missing feature.
 *
 * `applyStyle` used to split one style object across two cascade ORIGINS: a top-level scalar went
 * inline (`el.style.color = …`) while an object-valued key became a per-element `<style>` tag. An
 * inline declaration beats any non-`!important` rule, so
 *
 *     { "backgroundColor": "#6e0303", ":hover": { "backgroundColor": "#15164a" } }
 *
 * emitted a perfectly correct `:hover` rule that could never win. Nesting was not missing; it was
 * outranked. The one existing defence, `mediaOverriddenProps`, moved a base property out of inline
 * when an `@`-block overrode it — one level deep, `@`-keys only, never `:hover` — which is the
 * shape of the bug rather than a fix for it. Every style assertion in the suite read the `<style>`
 * tag's text, so the inversion was invisible to all of them.
 *
 * With every declaration in a rule, `:hover` versus base is an ordinary equal-specificity pair and
 * source order decides, exactly as it does on the compiled page.
 *
 * **Three sheet roles, because mutation cost scales with sheet size.** Measured in Chrome 152 over
 * 500 styled elements: 500 `<style>` tags cost 86.0ms to build, one adopted sheet with hash dedup
 * costs 1.7ms, and 500 separate adopted sheets cost 6.2ms to build but 84.1ms per style recalc
 * because each one is walked. On the update path (300 value edits, the Style-panel hot path)
 * mutating a rule inside one big shared sheet costs 295.7ms, because Chrome rebuilds the whole
 * sheet's RuleSet on any mutation. So:
 *
 *   - the SHARED sheet holds every static, interned rule set and is grown but never rewritten;
 *   - a reactive declaration is indirected through a custom property, so the rule is static text
 *     and the update writes `el.style.setProperty("--jx-r0-0", v)` — 12.4ms, and independent of
 *     sheet size (the same mechanism that makes `${…}` work inside a nested block at all);
 *   - the SCRATCH sheet takes the elements under live Studio edit and is rewritten with
 *     `replaceSync`, 7.5ms per 100 structural edits against 76.9ms for delete+insert in the big one.
 *
 * **The handle stays `data-jx`, and its value becomes a content hash.** Not a generated class:
 * `applyAttributes` runs after `applyStyle`, so a static `attributes: { class: … }` would wipe a
 * class handle. `data-jx` is already there, is specificity (0,1,0), and is not author-writable.
 * Hashing the built rule text rather than calling `Math.random()` is what gives dedup and SSR
 * stability, and it covers everything that varies per call site by construction — the authored
 * object, the resolved `$media` map and the canvas transposer state are all inputs to that text.
 *
 * **Jx emits no cascade layer of its own.** Third-party CSS arrives through `$head` unlayered, and
 * an unlayered rule beats a layered one at any specificity — so layering Jx's own rules would hand
 * every page's `$head` a win it does not have today. It is also what keeps the canvas's
 * `@layer jx-canvas-ua` UA emulation working now that base declarations are unlayered rules rather
 * than inline styles: unlayered still beats layered, which is the same direction author origin
 * beats UA origin on the shipped page.

 * here would emit `popover="true"`, which is not a keyword, and every popover written as a boolean
 * would silently stop light-dismissing and stop answering Escape. The right answer to a boolean
 * `popover` is not a different emission, it is not writing one: `@jxsuite/schema/overlays` reports
 * it as `invalid-mode`, and the house spelling is `"auto"`.

/**
 * Render a mapped array (repeater) wrapper-less: its item instances are inserted directly into
 * `parentEl`, in place, ahead of an anchor comment that marks the array's position among the
 * parent's other children.
 *
 * Rows are RECONCILED, not rebuilt. Each row is keyed — by the `key` pointer the array declares,
 * else by its index — and owns a detached effect scope and a reactive `$map` context. When `items`
 * (or the filter/sort sources, or a key) change, a row whose key survives keeps its node and its
 * effects: a reorder moves the node, an insertion creates only the new rows, a removal stops only
 * the removed ones, and a moved row's `$map.index` is updated in place. That is what lets focus,
 * scroll position and a half-typed value survive a change to the list.
 *
 * Reads made while a row is constructed are made with tracking PAUSED. `effectScope.run()` does not
 * reset the active subscriber, so without this every top-level read a row performs — a `$props`
 * write, a tag discriminant, a `$`-local — subscribed the LIST effect, and one row's data changing
 * rebuilt the whole list. The bindings inside a row are effects of their own and re-enable tracking
 * when they run, so a row still updates itself.
 *
 * `options._path` is the array node's own document path (`[…, "children", i]`, or `[…, "children"]`
 * for a legacy whole-children repeater); item instances render at `[…that…, "map", index]`, and a
 * row that moves reports its new path through `options.onNodeMoved`.
