 * The CSS-authoring rules that are not the DOM.

 * it. They are pure string and regex math over what a `style` block MEANS — how a property name is
 * spelled in CSS, which media query an `@`-key resolves to, and which selector pair a
 * scheme-conditional rule dual-emits as.
 *
 * The rule builder joined them for the same reason: it is what a style object MEANS as a list of
 * CSS rules, and three emitters used to answer that question three different ways. Its only import
 * is `@jxsuite/schema/guards`, which imports nothing but types.
 *
 * They are a subpath of their own because of who else needs them. `@jxsuite/site/site-style` turns
 * `project.json`'s `style` into a stylesheet, and it runs in places the DOM runtime cannot go — a
 * static build, and a Cloudflare Worker serving a live preview. Importing the root export for
 * `camelToKebab` would put the whole renderer plus `@vue/reactivity` inside a Worker script for
 * four pure functions.
 *
 * `./runtime` re-exports all of these, so nothing that already imported them from the root export
 * has to change. This is a narrow door beside the wide one, not a replacement for it.
