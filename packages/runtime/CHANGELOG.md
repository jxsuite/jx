# Changelog

## [4.0.0](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/compare/runtime-v3.1.0...runtime-v4.0.0) (2026-09-06)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **runtime,compiler,site,studio:** `@jxsuite/runtime` no longer writes authored declarations to `el.style`, so code reading them back off an element after `applyStyle` sees nothing. The `elementStyleTags` export is replaced by `releaseElementStyles` and `resetDocumentStyles`, which refcount a shared rule set rather than handing out an element to remove by hand; `documentStyleText` reads back what was written.

### Features

* popovers become a first-class thing the canvas can open, and a rule it can check ([bf757f1](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/bf757f1c9a9d94e15cbaac3be5405588c082cee3))
* **runtime,compiler,site,studio:** authored styles become adopted CSS rules ([1542477](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/15424770e40f979eaaad78682004cf8d87f8180f))
* **runtime:** declaration-body at-rules, and the canvas hooks a popover needs ([a701ee1](https://github.com/jxsuite/jx/commit/a701ee1f2434e1153cddfa1b536c97ba8c849eda))
