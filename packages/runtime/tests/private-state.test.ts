 * interface — never in the property panel, never in an exported CEM manifest, and never settable
 * through `$props`. The first two clauses were enforced in the studio; this file is about the
 * third, which is the runtime's, and which was unenforced.
 *
 * The point is a negative, so nearly every test asserts that a value did NOT change. The failure
 * these guard against is silent by construction: an unguarded path does not error, it just writes.
