# Jx Packages

The core packages are the Jx framework itself. [`extensions/*`](../extensions/README.md) extends Jx through the public hooks any third party can use; `packages/*` is what gets extended. The dependency edge between the two is one-way, and it is the rule that defines this directory: see [specs/extensions.md §2](../specs/extensions.md).

| Package                           | What it is                                                                     |

| [`@jxsuite/starters`](./starters) | Starter catalogue: `registry.json` plus one buildable project each             |
| [`@jxsuite/import`](./import)     | Clone a live website into a Jx project                                         |
| [`@jxsuite/markup`](./markup)     | HTML → Jx nodes, Markdown → sanitized HTML                                     |
| [`@jxsuite/formulas`](./formulas) | Composite pure formulas authored as declarative `$expression` JSON             |
| [`@jxsuite/ui`](./ui)             | The UI kit: interface elements authored as Jx documents, their theme and icons |

## Rules

- Core packages may depend on each other. **Core packages may never depend on an extension**: no `dependencies`, `peerDependencies`, or `optionalDependencies` entry, and no `@jxsuite/<extension>` import from `src/`. `devDependencies` are permitted (test fixtures only), because the publish graph uses runtime deps.
- Enforced on every PR by `bun scripts/check-dep-rules.ts` in the ungated `checks` job. The source scan is not redundant with the manifest check: Bun hoists workspace packages to the root `node_modules`, so an undeclared import would resolve at runtime and pass every test silently. It matches import/re-export/`import()`/`require()` specifiers only. A quoted mention in an error message is deliberately not a violation.
- The sole carve-out is [`packages/desktop`](./desktop), allowlisted in that script with a rationale. An allowlisted directory is skipped for **both** the manifest check and the source scan, so a second entry weakens the rule everywhere it applies.
- Intra-repo dependencies are always `workspace:^`.
- Every non-`private` package needs a `LICENSE` file, because `bun run docs:claims` fails without one.

## Layout

Each directory is a Bun workspace member through the root `packages/*` glob and carries the same furniture: `package.json`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `bunfig.toml`, `src/` and `tests/`. Three exceptions are worth knowing before a typecheck surprises you:

- `create` and `starters` keep their sources at the package root (`starters/index.ts`, `create/generate.ts`), which is outside the root tsconfig's `packages/**/src/**/*` include, so they carry their own `tsconfig.json`. They declare no `typecheck` script, so root `bun run typecheck` covers only their tests.
- `desktop` is excluded from the root tsconfig entirely (electrobun ships raw `.ts` in its dist) and runs its own `typecheck` script as a separate CI step.
- `packages/*/coverage` and `packages/*/dist` are gitignored, as is `packages/starters/sites/*/bun.lock` (the stray install left behind by opening a starter in Studio).

## Testing

`bun test --isolate` only; plain `bun test` has known order-dependent failures and is unsupported.

```sh
# from the workspace, so its own bunfig.toml applies
cd packages/<pkg> && bun test --isolate --coverage

# from the repo root
bun scripts/check-coverage-manifest.ts packages/<pkg>
```

Each `bunfig.toml` sets `coverageThreshold = { lines, functions }`, which Bun enforces **per file**, not as an aggregate. The keys must be plural or Bun ignores them silently. `coveragePathIgnorePatterns` excludes sibling workspaces on purpose: `../protocol/src/routes.ts` reads 33% functions inside a consumer's run and 100% under protocol's own, so a sibling's source in your coverage table is a missing ignore pattern, not a regression.

The CI matrix is **derived** from disk by `scripts/ci/affected.ts`, not hand-listed. A new package therefore needs no workflow edit, but it must ship a `bunfig.toml` with a `coverageThreshold`, or the first job in the graph fails the run by name. A suite that reads files outside its own workspace needs an `EXTRA_EDGES` entry there naming the test that proves it, and those evidence paths are `existsSync`-checked before any other job starts.

## Publishing and versioning

Every package except `desktop` publishes to npm as raw TypeScript source: `exports` point at `.ts` files (`./src/*.ts` everywhere but `create` and `starters`, whose sources sit at the package root), `files` ships those sources, `publishConfig.provenance` is on. `desktop` declares no `exports`, `main`, `files`, `publishConfig` or `license`, so `scripts/publish-order.ts` drops it from the npm set. `desktop` ships as installers attached to the `desktop-v*` GitHub release, and still needs a version and a tag because the bundler workflows check out `desktop-v<version>`. Which of those installers may be called _signed_ is `packages/desktop/release-assets.json`'s answer, not prose's: only the macOS DMGs carry `signed: true` today.

Versioning is the monorepo release train: release-please, one component per package. [`extensions/*`](../extensions/README.md) rides it on the same terms. The component list is checked against the workspace graph in both directions by `scripts/release-config.test.ts` (two extensions once sat unlisted, hence the test). The `runtime`, `parser`, `compiler` and `server` components carry `extra-files` that rewrite the version ranges shipped inside templates (`packages/starters/sites/*/package.json` and `packages/create/template-versions.json`) as part of the release commit. Those files are generated: `bun run templates:check` blocks in CI and `bun run templates:sync` is the fixer. Ranges left to drift make a starter uninstallable and raise a dependency-update dialog over the canvas.

## Surprises

- **The `jx` binary runs `dist/cli.js`, not `src/`.** Probing compiler behavior through the bin without rebuilding silently tests stale code; run `bun run build:compiler` first, or invoke `packages/compiler/src/cli.ts` directly.
- **The canonical Bun pin is `.github/actions/setup-bun`**, which is what `test.yml` uses; the other workflows still call `oven-sh/setup-bun` with their own copy of the same version, so a bump has to reach all of them. Coverage instrumentation shifts between Bun versions, so bumping it also means re-baselining every `packages/*/bunfig.toml` in the same PR.
- **Do not restate counts in prose**: not the number of packages here, and especially not the number of starters. `bun run docs:claims` reads `packages/starters/registry.json` and fails the root README or any marketing page that disagrees; it does not scan package READMEs, so there the habit is the only guard.
- **A `bun install`ed starter root shadows this workspace**: it materialises a published `@jxsuite/schema` beside the far-ahead local copy. `bun run schema:generate-all` cleans those roots first via `scripts/check-shadowed-core.ts --fix`.
