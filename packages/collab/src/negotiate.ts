/**
 * WebSocket subprotocol negotiation for the collab socket (RFC 6455 §1.9, §4.2.2).
 *
 * **The token names the wire envelope, not the package.** `jx.collab.v1` means "I speak the frame
 * layout `envelope.ts` documents". There is one token per envelope **major**, and the rule for
 * bumping it is narrow on purpose: bump when {@link decodeFrame} would _mis-parse_ a peer's frame —
 * a field reordered, a type widened, a length prefix changed. **Do not bump for a new frame type.**
 * Both halves already skip a frame type they do not know, so a v1 peer and a v1-plus-one-frame peer
 * interoperate; bumping there would refuse a room that would have worked.
 *
 * **Why the capability probe does the negotiating.** RFC 6455 §4.1 requires a client that offered
 * subprotocols and received no echo to _fail the connection_, and browsers enforce it. So a new
 * Studio that unconditionally offered `jx.collab.v1` would lose collab entirely against an older
 * dev server — a regression caused by the fix. The probe already exists, already returns a version
 * the client discards, and runs before the socket: it is the one place the client can learn what
 * the server speaks without risking the handshake. Hence {@link negotiateCollab}, which turns a
 * probe body into the list to offer — empty against a server that advertises nothing.
 *
 * **Nothing here may go in the `hello` control message.** That arrives after the socket is up and
 * after frames may already have been exchanged, which is too late to prevent the divergent-history
 * merge `schema.ts` warns about. Negotiation has to conclude before a byte of document state
 * moves.
 *
 * This module imports nothing, deliberately: the Studio platform adapters read it eagerly, before
 * the dynamic import that pulls in Yjs, so it must not drag the CRDT into the initial bundle.
