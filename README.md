  A full-stack web framework with a visual editor, built on plain JSON and Markdown.<br> Sites compile to static HTML, so they are quick to serve, have almost no attack surface, and cost close to nothing to run. Pages, styles, state, data, and server logic are all declarative documents. Edit them in code, on a canvas, or with an agent.

## What is Jx?

A Jx project is a directory of JSON and Markdown files. Routes come from the filesystem. Components are JSON documents whose property names mirror the DOM API. Reactivity is [`@vue/reactivity`](https://github.com/vuejs/core/tree/main/packages/reactivity). State entries marked `timing: "server"` run on the server.

```json
{
  "$id": "Counter",
  "state": {
    "count": 0,
    "increment": { "$prototype": "Function", "body": "state.count++" }
  },
  "tagName": "my-counter",
  "children": [
    { "tagName": "span", "textContent": "${state.count}" },
    { "tagName": "button", "textContent": "+", "onclick": { "$ref": "#/state/increment" } }
  ]
}
```

Every document validates against a JSON Schema 2020-12 meta-schema generated from the live web platform, so the same file is legible to a person, a visual editor, and a model. The full format is documented under [Framework](https://jxsuite.com/docs/framework): state shapes, bindings, repeaters, props, statements, styling.

## The stack

| Layer       | What ships                                                                                          |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Routing** | File-based. `[param].json` and `[...path].json` catch-alls, enumerated at build time via `$paths`   |
| **Content** | Markdown collections with frontmatter schemas, Jx Markdown directives, relationships                |
| **Styling** | Design tokens, breakpoints, states and selectors, a forced color-scheme contract                    |
| **Logic**   | Reactive state, template expressions, declarative statements, sidecar JS modules                    |
| **Server**  | `timing: "server"` state entries compile to `POST /_jx/server/<fn>`; secrets never leave the server |
| **Data**    | D1, Supabase, and SQLite connections; CRUD over `/_jx/data`; additive schema sync via `jx db push`  |
| **Auth**    | Better Auth sessions, sign-in flows, and per-table permission rules over `/_jx/auth`                |
| **Search**  | A build-time index over your content collections plus a headless browser client                     |
| **Assets**  | Responsive image pipeline (WebP/AVIF), sitemap, robots, redirects                                   |
| **Output**  | Static HTML by default; adapters for `cloudflare-workers`, `cloudflare-pages`, `node`, and `bun`    |

Pages are prerendered at build time and interactivity hydrates as islands. Static pages ship no JavaScript. The generated worker serves `/_jx/*` (server functions, data, auth) and your static assets; it does not render pages per request.

## Quick start

```bash
bun create @jxsuite my-site
cd my-site
bun run dev
```

The `jx` CLI drives the rest:

```bash
jx dev        # dev server with live reload
jx build      # compile the site to dist/
jx preview    # serve an already-built dist/
jx schema     # generate self-contained JSON Schemas for the project
jx validate   # validate project.json, documents, classes, and extension fragments
jx db push    # sync data tables to their connections (additive only)
```

Start from a blank project or one of 13 starters. Publishing is git-push-driven: commit, and your host builds. See [Build output and adapters](https://jxsuite.com/docs/framework/site/deployment).

## Studio

Jx Studio is a desktop application for editing Jx projects, and the desktop app is how you run the visual editor today. Jx Cloud, a hosted version you reach in a browser and sign in to with GitHub, is in development. Contributors working in this repository can also run Studio in the browser via the dev server.

  <img src="docs/images/hero.png" alt="Jx Studio editing the jxsuite.com homepage: layers panel, live canvas, and element inspector" width="800">
</p>

Four modes over the same files: **Manage** (project explorer, content models, media), **Edit** (inline WYSIWYG authoring that saves as Markdown), **Design** (canvas, breakpoints, CSS inspector, tokens), and **Script** (state, data, events, and a Monaco editor for functions). Git is built in: stage, diff, commit, branch, and push without leaving the app. Multiple people can co-edit one project in real time against a shared backend.

[Download Jx Studio](https://jxsuite.com/download) for macOS, Windows, or Linux.

## Built for agents

The document format is the contract, so a model works on exactly the artifact a person does:

- **`jx schema`** emits self-contained schemas for your project. They resolve with no
  `node_modules` and no network, so any validator can check generated output offline.
- **`jx validate`** is a deterministic pass/fail over the whole project, which makes it a usable CI
  gate for machine-written documents.
- **Studio's assistant** edits through the same document operations a person uses, so an AI change
  lands in the undo stack and in your git diff like any other edit. Bring your own key; Studio ships no account and no hosted model, and sends nothing anywhere until you connect a provider.
- **[`.claude/commands/jx.md`](.claude/commands/jx.md)** is a ready-made `/jx` authoring command for
  coding agents working in a Jx project.

## Extending

An extension is an npm package with a `jx-extension.json` manifest contributing classes, JSON Schema fragments, and capability methods. Core packages never depend on extensions (a CI rule enforces it), so the first-party extensions below use the same public hooks yours would.
