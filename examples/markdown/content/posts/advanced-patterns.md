Once you have the basics down, Jx offers several powerful patterns for building complex applications.

## Dynamic Component Switching

Use `$switch` to conditionally render components based on signal values:

```json
{
  "$switch": { "$ref": "#/$defs/$currentRoute" },
  "cases": {
    "home": { "$ref": "./views/home.json" },
    "about": { "$ref": "./views/about.json" }
  }
}
```

## Content Collections

With the `@jxplatform/md` library and **external class integration**, you can build Astro-like content pipelines entirely within Jx's declarative model.

### Markdown as a Data Source

Glob a directory of markdown files and render them as a list:

```json
{
  "$prototype": "MarkdownCollection",
  "$src": "@jxplatform/md",
  "src": "./content/posts/*.md",
  "sortBy": "frontmatter.date",
  "timing": "compiler"
}
```

### Directives Inside Markdown

Embed custom elements directly in your markdown content using directive syntax.

## Compile-Time Processing

The Jx compiler produces five output tiers depending on how dynamic your component is:

| Surface              | Output                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Fully static         | Plain HTML, zero JS       |
| Signals only         | HTML + signal init script |
| Signals + handlers   | HTML + module script      |
| Server-timed Request | HTML with baked data      |

This means a blog built with `MarkdownCollection` and `timing: "compiler"` ships **zero JavaScript** for the index page.
