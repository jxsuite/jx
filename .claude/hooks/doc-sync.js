// Stop hook — advisory docs/spec sync check. When the session's uncommitted
// changes touch source files that user docs declare (via `code:` frontmatter or
// `@docs` tags), surface the affected pages/specs back to Claude ONCE per stop
// chain so behavior changes ship with their documentation. stop_hook_active
// guards the loop: after Claude has seen the report and stops again, we let it.
//
// It also runs the two MARKDOWN gates over the session's own changed `.md`
// files, and that placement is the point. `.claude/hooks/validate-edit.js` runs
// the same two per edit, but ONLY on an Edit/Write/MultiEdit tool call — a page
// rewritten through Bash (a `sed`, a heredoc, `format:md`) never reaches it.
// That is not hypothetical: it is how seven em dashes reached CI. A Stop hook
// asks about the WORKING TREE, so the editing route stops mattering.
//
// Advisory by design — exit 2 feeds the report back as feedback; Claude either
// updates the docs or states why no update is needed. Never blocks repeatedly.
