# `@jxsuite/schema` Specification

## JSON Schema 2020-12 Meta-Schema Generator

**Version:** 0.4.9-draft\
**Status:** Partial\
**Updated:** 2026-09-02\
**License:** MIT

---

## 1. Overview

`@jxsuite/schema` generates three Jx meta-schemas — JSON Schema 2020-12 documents that validate Jx source files:

1. **Component schema** (`schema.json`) — validates Jx component, page, and layout files
2. **Project schema** (`project-schema.json`) — validates `project.json` configuration files
3. **Class schema** (`class-schema.json`) — validates `.class.json` class definition files

The component schema is derived at generation time from web standards data (`@webref/css`, `@webref/elements`, `@webref/idl`), ensuring it stays current with browser capabilities. The project and class schemas are static.

## 3. Schema Coverage

### 3.1 Component Schema (`schema.json`)

**`$id`:** `https://jxsuite.com/schema/v1`

Root-level fields: `$schema`, `$id`, `$defs`, `state`, `tagName`, `children`, `$media`, `$elements`, `$head`, `$layout`, `$paths`, `$lang`, `$dir`, `$sitemap`, `title`, `imports`, `observedAttributes`, `cases`, `style`, `attributes`.

- `$lang` and `$dir` are page-level overrides of `defaults.lang` / `defaults.dir`, written onto `<html>` (site-architecture.md §8.4)
- **`$sitemap` was read by the build and declared nowhere**, so a page opting out of the sitemap failed `jx validate` against its own closed entry document
- **`HeadEntry.textContent` accepts an object** as well as a string: that is how a JSON-LD block is authored, and the compiler serializes it (site-architecture.md §8.5)
- `tagName` is optional (pages with `$layout` may omit it)
- `tagName` enumeration: all standard HTML elements derived from `@webref/elements`
- `children`: array of element definitions and/or text nodes, or Array namespace (`$prototype: "Array"`)

#### `state` Entry Shapes

| Shape                                        | Schema Definition                                                     | Status          |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Naked value (scalar, array, object)          | `StateEntry.oneOf`                                                    | **Implemented** |
| Typed value (`TypedStateDef` with `default`) | `TypedStateDef` with `attribute`, `reflects`, `deprecated` CEM fields | **Implemented** |
| Computed (template string containing `${}`)  | String pattern match                                                  | **Implemented** |
| Function (`$prototype: "Function"`)          | `FunctionDef` with `body`, `parameters`, `$src`, `$export`, `emits`   | **Implemented** |
| External class (`$prototype: <ClassName>`)   | `ExternalClassDef` with all built-in prototypes                       | **Implemented** |

#### `$defs` Pure Type Definitions

`PureTypeDef` — requires `type`, forbids `default` and `$prototype`.

#### Built-in Prototypes

All 13 built-in prototypes with their specific configuration properties:

- `Request` — url, method, headers, body, debounce, manual, urlParams, timing
- `URLSearchParams` — default params
- `FormData` — default fields
- `LocalStorage` / `SessionStorage` — key, default value
- `Cookie` — name, maxAge, path, domain, secure, sameSite
- `IndexedDB` — database, version, store, indexes, keyPath
- `Array` — items, map, filter, sort, key (a `$map/item` pointer; spec.md §10.4)
- `Set` / `Map` — default values
- `Blob` — parts, type
- `ReadableStream` — (stub)

#### Element Properties

- All standard HTML DOM properties derived from `@webref/idl`
- CSSOM camelCase style properties derived from `@webref/css`
- All `EventHandler` names (onclick, oninput, etc.) derived from IDL
- Every `on*` handler accepts a `$ref` binding, an inline `$expression`, or an inline `FunctionDef` (`$prototype: "Function"` with `body` and `parameters`/legacy `arguments`)
- `StyleObject` is recursive: selector and at-rule groups nest to arbitrary depth (spec.md §9.2); the project-level `style` shares the same contract
- `ChildrenValue` accepts a `${…}` template string resolving at build time to an array of child definitions (spec.md §8.4), alongside the array and Array-namespace forms
- Element-level `$switch`/`cases`: the discriminant is a `StateRef` (`#/state/…`), and `cases` maps case values to element definitions or external component refs (spec.md §14.1). `SwitchNode` is admitted **as a child**, under `ChildrenValue`'s item alternatives — which are `anyOf`, not `oneOf`, because a switch child may also carry the `tagName` of its own container and would otherwise match two branches and be rejected for matching both. It was defined and referenced from nowhere until 2026-08-09, so every document with a `$switch` child failed validation while the compiler rendered it correctly.
- **`TagName` is a name, never an expression** — `pattern` `^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9._-]*$`.
- **`ElementTagName` = `TagName` | `{ $expression: TagExpression }`**, wired into `ElementDef` alone. `TagExpression` is a closed two-branch def (`?:` and `switch`) whose every RESULT operand `$ref`s `TagName` — so the pattern above is kept rather than relocated, and the candidate set is readable straight out of the JSON without evaluating anything. The document root and `SwitchNode`'s container keep the bare `TagName`; `HeadEntry` declares its own. `default` and `initial` are required here, unlike the expression-level `switch`, because an element with no tag cannot exist. Resolved once, at element creation — see spec.md §19.6.
- **`$head` items are `HeadEntry`, not `ElementDef`.** They had been elements, which was harmless only while an element's tag was a plain name: the moment one could be chosen, a head tag could be too, and `head-merger.ts` splices it into the built page as `<${tag} …>`. This also un-orphaned `HeadEntry`, whose only inbound `$ref` had been its own recursive `children`. No position in the pipeline evaluates a `${…}` in tag position, and each consumer failed differently and silently when one was written: the runtime threw `InvalidCharacterError` from `createElement`, the compiler emitted a lit binding in tag position, and the static renderer re-resolved the emitted HTML against the _page_ scope — where a component's own `state` does not exist — so a built page collapsed to the fallback branch's tag carrying the other branch's attributes. Vary an element with `$switch`.
- **`ExternalClassDef` is one flat property set shared by every state `$prototype`**, so a property name it defines for a built-in constrains every extension class that declares the same name. `filter` and `sort` are therefore unions (reactive `$ref`, single object, ordered rule array) rather than the `$ref`-only shape the built-in `Array` prototype wants: both `@jxsuite/parser`'s ContentCollection and `@jxsuite/connector`'s TableQuery declare `filter` as a rule array, and the narrower core shape silently overrode the class's own declaration.

### 3.2 Project Schema (`project-schema.json`)

> **Status: Implemented.** Every declared key is described, and the language-tag keys carry a pattern, so `jx validate` and the build no longer disagree about the same value. See §7 for exactly how much of BCP 47 a `pattern` can carry.

**`$id`:** `https://jxsuite.com/schema/project/v1`

Validates `project.json` files with:

- `name`, `url` — project metadata
- `defaults` — default page settings (`layout`, `lang`, `charset`)
- `$head` — global `<head>` entries
- `$elements` — global custom element dependencies
- `imports` — global prototype-to-path import map
- `$media` — named media breakpoints
- `style` — global CSS styles
- `state` — site-wide reactive state
- `collections` — content collection definitions (`source`, `schema`, `$elements`)
- `redirects` — static redirect rules
- `build` — build configuration (`outDir`, `format`, `trailingSlash`, `adapter`)
- `i18n` — internationalization (`defaultLocale`, `locales`, `routing`)

**Language-tag keys carry a `pattern`.** `i18n.defaultLocale`, `i18n.locales[]` and `securityTxt.preferredLanguages[]` are all BCP 47 tags, and all three are validated at author time against `LANGUAGE_TAG_PATTERN` — one exported constant in `packages/schema/src/locale.ts`, so the schema and the build read the same source.

The pattern is deliberately looser than the build's `Intl.Locale` parse, and the direction of that inequality is the contract: **the pattern accepts every tag the build accepts**, so a project that compiles can never fail `jx validate`. It catches the class of mistake an author makes — an underscore for a hyphen, an empty subtag, a one-letter primary language — and leaves subtag ordering and registry membership to the build, which is where a full RFC 5646 parse already lives. A test asserts the inequality against a corpus rather than restating it as prose.

### 3.3 Class Schema (`class-schema.json`)

**`$id`:** `https://jxsuite.com/schema/class/v1`

Validates `.class.json` files with:

- `$prototype: "Class"` (required), `title` (required)
- `extends` — base class (string or `$ref`)
- `$implementation` — path to JS module
- `$defs.parameters` — typed parameter schemas
- `$defs.returnTypes` — output type schemas
- `$defs.fields` — class fields with role, access, scope
- `$defs.constructor` — constructor definition
- `$defs.methods` — methods and accessors; the `role` enum covers `method`/`accessor` plus every static capability role hosts dispatch on (with a `timing` array): the format roles `parse`, `serialize`, `discover`, `load` and the admission-block roles `projectData`, `resolvePaths`, `lower`, `emit`, `mount`, `dialect`, `deploySchema`, `bindings`, `testConnection`. The enum is kept in lockstep with format-registry's `EXTENSION_CAPABILITIES` by the drift-guard test (`packages/schema/tests/class-schema-drift.test.ts`); see specs/extensions.md §8
- Admission blocks (specs/extensions.md §6): `format` (`extensions`, `mediaType`, `documentKinds`, `exportTarget`, `remote`), `project` (`key` required; `title`, `description`, `referenceable`), `server` (`basePath` required; `order`, `module`), and `connector` (`provider` + `kind` required; `local`, `serve`, `module`, open for provider extras)
- `$studio` — studio control-surface hints (modes, documentMode, newFileTemplate, element/nesting constraints)

### 3.4 I-JSON at the Parse Boundary

> **Status: Implemented.** `ijson.ts`, enforced by `parse.ts` for every document, project config and class definition.

`JSON.parse` accepts documents that mean something other than what they say, and RFC 7493 names the two that matter here:

- **A repeated name** (§2.3). `JSON.parse` keeps the last and says nothing, so a document with two `state` keys — a bad merge, most often — loses the first one's contents silently.
- **An integer outside what a double holds** (§2.2). `9007199254740993` parses as `9007199254740992`, and the next serialization writes the wrong number back to disk.

Both are **parse failures**, not warnings. They are silent data loss, and neither has a reading under which the author got what they wrote. The whole repository — 375 JSON documents — was already clean when this landed, so the rule rejects mistakes rather than existing work.

This matters more in Jx than it would elsewhere. A Jx document does not stay JSON: it round-trips through markdown frontmatter (`parser.md`) and through a Yjs CRDT (`collab.md`), and each crossing rebuilds the object from the **parsed value**. Whatever `JSON.parse` discarded at the boundary is discarded for good, and the file the author reopens is not the file they wrote.

Detection is a scan of the source text rather than a `JSON.parse` reviver, because by the time a reviver runs the duplicate is already gone. **Fractions are never judged**: `0.1` is not exactly representable either, so flagging them would flag most real documents while saying nothing about whether the author's value survived.

### 3.5 Unicode Normalization at the Parse Boundary

> **Status: Implemented.** `parse.ts` puts every key and every string value into NFC, for documents, project configs and class definitions alike.

A state name is an **identifier**: declared as a key in `state`, referenced as `${state.état}` in a template and as `#/state/état` in a `$ref`. Typed on macOS it arrives decomposed (`e` + U+0301); typed on Windows, or pasted from most of the web, it arrives precomposed (U+00E9).

Those are two different JavaScript property names. A document whose declaration and reference were typed on different machines therefore **builds cleanly, emits a valid bundle, and renders nothing** — `state.état` is `undefined`, there is no error, and no search finds the problem because both spellings look identical in every editor. UAX #31 §R4 exists for this case, and NFC is the form the rest of the web platform assumes.

Two consequences are worth stating, because both look like overreach until the reason is given:

- **String values are normalized too, and that is not a content change.** Two canonically equivalent strings are the same text by UAX #15's own definition: a conforming renderer must display them identically and no process may distinguish them. It is also unavoidable — Jx has no syntactic boundary between content and code, since `"Café ${state.été}"` is one string carrying both, and normalizing "only identifier positions" would mean parsing every template to find them.
- **It runs on the parsed value, not on the source text.** `"état"` is pure ASCII until `JSON.parse` turns the escapes into a combining mark, so normalizing the text would miss exactly the documents a generator wrote.

NFC composes; it does not fold or strip. Scripts with no composed forms, CJK and emoji all survive byte for byte, and a test asserts it.

## 4. Generation Pipeline

1. Load web standards data from `@webref/css`, `@webref/elements`, `@webref/idl`
2. Extract HTML tag names and their valid properties
3. Extract CSS properties and convert to CSSOM camelCase
4. Extract DOM event handler names
5. Compose all three schemas
6. Write to `schema.json`, `project-schema.json`, `class-schema.json`

The component schema is regenerated when web standards packages are updated. The project and class schemas are static.

---

## 5. Output

Three JSON Schema 2020-12 documents:

```json
{ "$schema": "https://jxsuite.com/schema/v1" }
```

```json
{ "$schema": "https://jxsuite.com/schema/project/v1" }
```

```json
{ "$schema": "https://jxsuite.com/schema/class/v1" }

## 7. Standards Alignment

External standards this specification binds itself to. Vocabulary and cell grammar: [`standards.md`](./standards.md). `@webref/*` is a tooling package rather than a standard; what it carries are extracts of the specifications cited below.

Absent here: subtag ordering, the singleton rules, and registry membership — all of which stay with `Intl.Locale` at build time (`site-architecture.md` §13.2), and a test pins that the pattern accepts everything that parse accepts.                                                                                                            |
| [UAX #31](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/)                    | **Subset**  | §3.5   | packages/schema/src/parse.ts, packages/schema/tests/parse.test.ts                                                                                                  | §R4 Equivalent Normalized Identifiers: every key and string value crosses the parse boundary in NFC, so a name typed decomposed and referenced precomposed is one identifier rather than two. Absent: §R1's identifier profiles — Jx restricts what a state name may contain no further than ECMAScript does, since the name becomes a property on the `state` proxy. A document arriving through a format extension's own `parse` capability rather than through this boundary is that extension's responsibility. |
| [RFC 9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110)                  | **Subset**  | §3.2   | packages/schema/defs/project-config.schema.ts                                                                                                                      | `REDIRECT_STATUSES` enumerates the five §15.4 statuses a static host can express, and the compiler and the Studio grid both import it rather than declaring their own. A rewrite is a separate shape, not a sixth status — see site-architecture.md §11.3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Changelog

- **0.4.9-draft** (2026-09-02) — ArrayNamespace gains key, a $map/item pointer.
- **0.4.8-draft** (2026-08-16) — §3.5 documents, configs and class definitions cross the parse boundary in NFC (UAX #31 §R4).
- **0.4.7-draft** (2026-08-16) — §3.2 language-tag keys carry a BCP 47 pattern, so author-time and build-time agree; gap:bcp47-locale-validation closed.
- **0.4.6-draft** (2026-08-16) — §3.2 and §7: BCP 47 validation exists in the build; the schema is the half that still lacks it.
- **0.4.5-draft** (2026-08-15) — I-JSON enforced at the parse boundary: duplicate names and unrepresentable integers are parse failures (§3.4).
- **0.4.4-draft** (2026-08-15) — The class method role enum gains head (extensions.md §8.6).
- **0.4.3-draft** (2026-08-15) — §3.1 records the root fields the 0.4.2 entry described.
- **0.4.2-draft** (2026-08-15) — Document $lang, $dir and the previously undeclared $sitemap; defaults.dir; HeadEntry.textContent admits an object.
- **0.4.1-draft** (2026-08-15) — build.headers declares the response-header output (site-architecture.md §14.3).
- **0.4.0-draft** (2026-08-15) — redirects admits the object form the compiler and Studio already write, with an RFC 9110 status enum and a distinct rewrite shape; §3.2's redirect defect is resolved.
- **0.3.2-draft** (2026-08-15) — Add §7 Standards Alignment; §3.2 marked Partial — redirects and i18n do not describe what the rest of the platform reads.
- **0.3.1-draft** (2026-08-10) — §3.1 ElementTagName admits a TagExpression on ElementDef alone — a closed two-branch def whose every result $refs TagName, so the pattern is kept and the candidates stay enumerable; $head items are pinned to HeadEntry so a head tag cannot become choosable.
- **0.3.0-draft** (2026-08-09) — §3.1 TagName gains a pattern — a tag name is a name, never an expression, because no consumer evaluates one and each failed differently and silently; SwitchNode is admitted as a child under ChildrenValue (anyOf, so a switch child may still carry its container tagName); ExternalClassDef.filter widened to a union like sort, since one flat property set is shared by every $prototype and was overriding extension classes' own declared parameters.
- **0.2.8-draft** (2026-07-22) — Proper spec versioning (`fb0f3ec7`).
- **0.2.7-draft** (2026-07-22) — Machine-readable spec status vocabulary + generated status page (`79daba23`).
- **0.2.6-draft** (2026-07-22) — Align specs and docs with the bundled-schema validation contract (`ae861ff6`).
- **0.2.5-draft** (2026-06-10) — Consolidate markdown and csv handling to the parser package (`8b1ba6da`).
- **0.2.4-draft** (2026-05-18) — Always emit worker.js for cloudflare (`3dd37c2d`).
- **0.2.3-draft** (2026-05-15) — Provider-sepcific Site-Wide Bundling (`51cb5cf6`).
- **0.2.2-draft** (2026-04-23) — Site build (`ffe60ddc`).
- **0.2.1-draft** (2026-04-23) — Compiler cli + published site (`4607ebbc`).
- **0.2.0-draft** (2026-04-22) — Consolidate project config schema and rename as such (`e3523dbf`).
- **0.1.3-draft** (2026-04-20) — Text nodes support (`4d45eeb7`).
- **0.1.2-draft** (2026-04-16) — Landing site + working exports + release-it + linting (`a8409b5f`).
- **0.1.1-draft** (2026-04-15) — Rebrand to Jx / Jx Platform (`abc63f2d`).
- **0.1.0-draft** (2026-04-10) — Consolidate specs (`80ca313f`).
