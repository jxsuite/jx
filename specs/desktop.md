## 1. Overview

Jx Studio is designed for three deployment targets that share a single core codebase:

| Target            | Runtime                           | Backend                       | Storage                   | Status                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Desktop app**   | ElectroBun (Bun + native webview) | Bun process (local)           | Filesystem                | All platforms except NixOS   |
| **NixOS desktop** | Chromium `--app` + Bun            | `@jxsuite/server` (localhost) | Filesystem via dev server | NixOS only (via `nix build`) |
| **Dev mode**      | Chrome                            | `@jxsuite/server` (localhost) | Filesystem via dev server | Active (Studio development)  |
| **SaaS/PaaS**     | Browser                           | Session gateway over git      | Git repository            | Shipped (see §10)            |

### 1.1a Platform Strategy

The desktop runtime is chosen at **build time**, not runtime:

- **NixOS** → Chromium app-mode exclusively. ElectroBun cannot be built in a Nix sandbox, and Chromium provides superior Wayland support.
- **All other platforms** (macOS, Windows, non-NixOS Linux) → ElectroBun exclusively. Provides native CEF webview with embedded Bun process.

The studio package (`@jxsuite/studio`) contains all UI logic and is backend-agnostic. It communicates with its environment through a **Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL)** — an interface that each deployment target implements. The server package (`@jxsuite/server`) is one such implementation; the ElectroBun Bun process is another; a cloud API server is a third.

### 1.1 Relationship to Other Specs

- **[Studio Spec](studio.md)** — Defines the visual builder: canvas, layer tree, inspector, state model, keyboard shortcuts. This spec does not alter any of that.
- **[Site Architecture Spec](site-architecture.md)** — Defines project structure (`project.json`, `pages/`, `content/`, etc.), routing, layouts, content collections. This spec defines how Studio _discovers and opens_ those projects.
- **[Server Spec](server.md)** — Defines the `@jxsuite/server` dev server endpoints. This spec defines a backend API contract that the server must satisfy, and that other backends can also satisfy.

---

## 2. Design Constraints

### 2.1 Consistency

The UX and APIs must be consistent regardless of where the project lives. A user opening a project from the local filesystem, from a dev server, or from cloud storage should see the same file tree, the same component list, and the same editing experience. The underlying storage is an implementation detail hidden behind the PAL.

### 2.2 Modularity

The studio package is the heart of every deployment. It imports no platform-specific modules directly. Platform bindings are injected at startup via `registerPlatform()`. The server package is a flexible backend — not the only backend. Any service that implements the Backend API Contract (§5) is a valid backend.

### 2.3 Flexibility

Studio must run in Chrome during its own development (the current workflow). It must also run inside ElectroBun's native webview. And eventually inside a plain browser against a cloud API. No deployment target may require capabilities that break the others — platform-specific features (native dialogs, filesystem access) are accessed exclusively through the PAL.

---

## 3. Platform Abstraction Layer

The PAL is a plain JavaScript object conforming to a `StudioPlatform` interface. It is registered once at startup on `globalThis` (§3.3) and accessed through `getPlatform()`.

### 3.1 Interface

The canonical `StudioPlatform` interface is `packages/studio/src/types.ts` — roughly 70 members today. This spec deliberately does not duplicate it; the summary below names the member families and the model that governs them. The transport-level view of the same contract is the `STUDIO_ROUTES` table in `@jxsuite/protocol` (§5.1).

| Family                   | Representative members                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Session / project**    | `id`, `projectRoot`, `activate`, `openProject`, `openProjectPicker?`, `probeRootProject`, `createDestination`, `createProject`, `pickDirectory?`, `listStarters?`, `importSite?`, `listProjects?`, recent-projects persistence |
| **Filesystem**           | `listDirectory`, `readFile`, `writeFile`, `uploadFile`, `deleteFile`, `renameFile`, `findReferences?`, `createDirectory`, `locateFile`, `searchFiles`, `subscribeFileEvents?`                                                  |
| **Documents / formats**  | `discoverComponents`, `listFormats?`, `listExtensions?`, `listExtensionCatalog?`, `fetchProjectSchemas?`, `formatAction?`, `fetchPluginSchema`                                                                                 |
| **Packages**             | `listPackages`, `addPackage`, `removePackage`, `installDependencies?`, `packageVersions?`, `setPackageVersions?`                                                                                                               |
| **Git**                  | `gitStatus`, `gitCommit`, `gitPush`, `gitPull`, `gitDiff`, `gitCheckout`, `gitClone?`, `createPullRequest?`, …                                                                                                                 |
| **Collab**               | `collab?` (realtime co-editing handle per document)                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Data / secrets**       | `dataConnections?`, `dataRows?`, row CRUD, `dataPush?`, `listSecrets?`, `setSecrets?`                                                                                                                                          |
| **Publish / identity**   | `getUser?`, `getAccountStatus?`, `listRepos?`, `importProject?`, `cfConnection?`, `cfConnect?`, `cfApi?`                                                                                                                       |
| **Site preview / build** | `previewSite?`, `setPreviewOverlay?`, `clearPreviewOverlay?`, `buildSite?` (specs/studio.md §10.1, §10.2)                                                                                                                      |
| **Code services / AI**   | `codeService` (§5.3), `resolveClass?`, `aiChatUrl`                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Multi-window / shell** | `openProjectInNewWindow?`, `pickProject?`, `newWindow?`, `setWindowProject?`, `getProjectRoot?`, `getAppInfo?`, `getSettings?`, `patchSettings?`                                                                               |
| **Canvas**               | `canvasUrl?`, `canvasUrlDeferred?`, `documentBaseUrl?`, `assetSpace?`, `assetCapabilities?`                                                                                                                                    |

**Every path across the PAL is project-relative, in both directions.** A caller passes `components/card.json`, and a member that reports paths reports them in that same space — including the refactor members, whose reports name files the sweep found. Where a backend speaks a different space, the adapter translates, and it translates in ONE direction only: an adapter that both prefixes a request and strips a prefix off the reply is asserting that the backend echoes its own input space, which is a property of a particular route rather than of the protocol. The dev server's own convention is stated in `server.md` §4.1.

**User settings are written as PATCHES, never as the whole map.** `patchSettings({ set, remove })` must leave a key named by neither exactly as it found it, and answers with the store as it then stands. A whole-map write cannot express "change this one thing", so every writer implicitly claims the whole store: on the chromium launcher, where each window is its own process with its own browser profile and therefore its own `localStorage`, a welcome window holding no settings overwrote the credentials another window had just stored — and a `settings.json` was left holding one key of the three its owner had configured. The rule also preserves keys the writing build does not know: one written by a newer version, or by hand. A backend applies the patch under a lock that spans the read and the write, so two concurrent patches compose rather than one overwriting the other.

**The canvas needs project files at a URL, not behind `readFile`.** It renders in an iframe, and the renderer resolves a component `$ref` by fetching it, so a platform must be able to say where the project tree is served. `documentBaseUrl` is that declaration. It defaults to `<canvas origin>/<projectRoot>/`, which is already right for any backend serving the tree from its web root — the dev server and the desktop loopback both do — and **MUST** be set by a platform whose `projectRoot` is an identifier rather than a served path. It may be absolute or root-relative; a root-relative value is resolved against the canvas origin, because the canvas composes it as `new URL(path, base)` and a relative base throws rather than resolving — which fails the whole canvas MOUNT, not one fetch. A host that answers a missing file with a single-page fallback compounds a wrong base rather than exposing it: the shell arrives at HTTP 200, so the fetch succeeds and the failure surfaces from the JSON parser instead.

**A platform also declares what its ORIGIN answers.** `documentBaseUrl` says where the project tree is served; `assetSpace` says whether the canvas document's own origin serves the published SITE URL space as well. They are different questions, and only the first has a default that is usually right. A backend serving the tree from its web root answers both by construction — the dev server and the desktop loopback do, and declare nothing. A platform on a shared editor origin declares `assetSpace: "repo"` **together with** `documentBaseUrl`, and Studio then addresses every media reference as a project file under that base rather than as a site URL (`studio.md` §3.4). Neither declaration is discoverable: a single-page fallback answers a missing asset with the shell at HTTP 200, so there is nothing for the canvas to detect.

**Core vs. optional, and degradation.** Required members are the minimal backend every platform implements. Optional members (marked `?` in the interface) each back an optional protocol route; Studio feature-detects them and degrades gracefully when they are absent — hiding the corresponding UI or falling back to a client-side path. Each optional route's `degradation` note in `STUDIO_ROUTES` records exactly what turns off (e.g. no `collab` → Studio edits solo with file-level saves; no `importSite` → the New Project modal hides its Import tab).

**Launcher-only extras are not interface members.** A platform may carry capabilities that only one shell can have — the desktop's `updater` and `windowControls` are the two today. These deliberately stay **out** of `StudioPlatform`: Studio reaches them by feature-detecting `globalThis.__jxPlatform` against its own local shape (see `resize-edges.ts`, `panels/toolbar.ts`), which is what lets the same shell code run unchanged where they do not exist. The consequence for adapter authors is that a factory annotated `(): StudioPlatform` **erases its own extras** — every caller, including its tests, then sees an object without them. Let the return type be inferred and assert conformance instead (`return platform satisfies StudioPlatform`), which also keeps the optional members the launcher does implement from reading as possibly-absent at the call site.

### 3.2 Types

The wire shapes the interface exchanges (`DirEntry`, `ComponentMeta`, `GitStatusResult`, `DataRowsQuery`, `StarterInfo`, …) live in `@jxsuite/protocol` and are re-exported from `packages/studio/src/types.ts`, so every backend serializes the same JSON the dev server does. Project configuration is the `ProjectConfig` type from `@jxsuite/schema/types` (the parsed `project.json`). `openProject()` resolves to `{ config, handle }`, where the handle is `{ root, name, projectConfig }` — `root` is a filesystem path locally and a project ID on cloud.

### 3.3 Registration

Registration lives in `packages/studio/src/platform.ts` and stores the adapter on `globalThis.__jxPlatform` — a global rather than a module-level variable, so a separate init bundle (e.g. the desktop `init.js`) can register the platform **before** the studio bundle loads, without needing to share module instances with it:

```typescript
// packages/studio/src/platform.ts
const g = globalThis as unknown as { __jxPlatform?: StudioPlatform };

export function registerPlatform(platform: StudioPlatform) {
  g.__jxPlatform = platform;
}

export function getPlatform() {
  if (!g.__jxPlatform) {
    throw new Error("No platform registered. Call registerPlatform() before starting Studio.");
  }
  return g.__jxPlatform;
}

export function hasPlatform() {
  return g.__jxPlatform != null;
}
```

Each deployment target either pre-registers its adapter before Studio initializes, or hands Studio a signal to build one itself. The desktop init bundle pre-registers the RPC-backed adapter on `__jxPlatform`.

**Where the init bundle is loaded from is a declared slot, not a string replace.** `studioShellHtml({ boot })` (studio.md §11.2) emits the module tags ahead of the studio entry. Both hosts used to obtain this by an exact-string `replace()` on the shipped `index.html`'s script tag; only the cloud's checked that the replace had matched, so a whitespace change upstream would have produced a packaged desktop app with no platform registered at all — which then self-registers the dev-server adapter and fetches `/__studio/*` against a `views://` origin. The ordering constraint below is unchanged and is why `boot` is a list rather than a single hook. The cloud shell (the platform repo's `edit-init`) instead publishes a `window.__jxCloud` signal — the bound project, or `null` for the project-less hub — and lets the studio entry construct the adapter, so the cloud adapter (and the collab WebSocket client's `yjs` instance) lives **inside** the studio bundle rather than the shell; a second bundled `yjs` in the shell would break collab's cross-module `instanceof` checks. When nothing pre-registered, the studio entry resolves the default adapter — cloud when `__jxCloud` was signalled, else the dev server:

```javascript
// Desktop (init bundle, loaded before studio.js) — pre-registers its adapter
import { registerPlatform } from "@jxsuite/studio/platform";
registerPlatform(createDesktopPlatform());

// Cloud shell (edit-init, loaded before studio.js) — publishes a signal, not an adapter
globalThis.__jxCloud = { project }; // project: CloudProject | null

// Studio entry (studio.ts) — build the default adapter when none was pre-registered
if (!hasPlatform()) {
  registerPlatform(resolveDefaultPlatform()); // cloud when __jxCloud is set, else dev server
}
```

### 3.4 Studio Startup Sequence

1. Platform adapter calls `registerPlatform(impl)`
2. Studio calls `loadProject()`:
   - If a project was previously open and the handle is still valid, reopen it
   - Otherwise, show the welcome state ("Open a project to get started")
3. When the user triggers "Open Project":
   - With `openProjectPicker: "repo-list"` (cloud), Studio shows its own repository picker over `listRepos` + `importProject` (write-access repositories only) and opens the choice through the recent-projects path — `openProject()` is never called
   - With a project already open on a platform that implements **both** `openProjectInNewWindow` and `pickProject`, Studio first asks **where** (§4.2a) and routes the answer
   - Otherwise Studio calls `getPlatform().openProject()` and the platform presents its native project opening flow
   - On success, Studio receives `{ config, handle }` and initializes the file tree

### 3.5 Leaving the Webview

**Both** desktop launchers register Studio's preview-navigation override (`@jxsuite/studio/preview-navigate`) so a link clicked in Preview mode goes to the **user's default browser** via an `openExternal` RPC, not to the editor's own window. Following a link in Preview exists to see the page behave like the deployed thing — routing, history, devtools — and neither a webview nor a frameless Chromium `--app` window is that; navigating either would also replace the editor. `View: Open in Browser` (§9.5) and the sign-in redirect (§3.6) use the same seam.

**Leaving the webview is one-way.** Nothing on this side can bring a browser tab back: no page can raise a background tab, and handing the OS opener a URL it already has open opens a DUPLICATE rather than switching to the existing one. That is why a live preview retargets its own tab over its reload channel (specs/studio.md §10.1) instead of asking the opener a second time, and why doing so reports where to look rather than pretending to raise anything.

The Bun side hands the URL over in two steps, and the second is not redundancy. ElectroBun's `Utils.openExternal` comes from `electrobun/bun` — the module the chromium launcher is defined by never loading — so when that is the only path, **every** URL on that build is silently dropped: a preview click did nothing at all and sign-in reported "Could not open a browser". The fallback hands the URL to the desktop's own opener (`xdg-open`, `open`, `rundll32 url.dll,FileProtocolHandler`) as a single argument with no shell, and only for `http`, `https` and `mailto`. The scheme restriction is the point of having a list at all: an opener resolves a scheme to whatever handler the desktop registered for it, and the pages whose links arrive here are a project's own content.

Refusal is a **return value**, not an exception — `{ ok: false }` — because both steps can decline without anything going wrong. A caller that branches only on a rejection loses the click, which is what both platform adapters did before. On a genuine refusal Studio's own `window.open` default applies.

### 3.6 Signing In

> **Status: Implemented.**

The desktop signs in to a provider with the **loopback redirect** of [RFC 8252](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8252) §7.3, protected by [PKCE](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636). The browser Studio keeps GitHub's device flow, and must: it has no loopback server to redirect to, and GitHub's device endpoints send no CORS headers, so the page cannot reach them either.

**The device flow is the wrong tool for a desktop app.** RFC 8628 designed it for clients that cannot show a browser or take typed input. A desktop app has both, and paying that price anyway means the user copies a code between two windows while the app polls a token endpoint on a timer.

Four properties are load-bearing, and each is a real attack or a real failure if dropped:

| Property                                                          | Why                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The redirect host is the literal `127.0.0.1`, never `localhost`   | §8.3 — a name resolves, and a `hosts` entry or a resolver answering `::1` sends the code somewhere the app is not listening |
| `S256`, never `plain`                                             | The code is the whole credential for a client with no secret; `plain` puts the verifier in the authorization request        |
| `state` is unguessable, single-use, and compared in constant time | Any local page can navigate a browser to the callback; without this the app adopts an attacker's account                    |
| The provider's page opens in the **user's own browser**           | §8.12 — an embedded webview can read what the user types into the provider's login form, and carries no existing session    |

**No client secret is sent.** A desktop app cannot keep one (§8.5): shipping it puts it in every copy of the binary, where it is a secret in name only. The PKCE verifier is what authenticates the exchange.

**The callback route is exempt from the project server's token gate, and only from that.** The provider redirects the user's browser to the `redirect_uri` it was given, and a page cannot append a secret to a URL it does not compose — a token gate there would make the flow impossible rather than safe. The Host check and Fetch Metadata still apply (§4.2 of `server.md`), and an IdP redirect is exactly the one cross-site shape the strict policy admits: a top-level GET document navigation. The callback page carries `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, because the authorization code is in that request's query string until it is exchanged.

**Where the token rests.** In the app's own config directory, in a file written owner-only (`0600`), **not** in `localStorage` and **not** in the settings store — the settings store is handed to the webview wholesale by `getSettings`. The RPC surface answers _whether_ a token exists and performs a sign-in; it never returns the store. The limitation is stated rather than hidden: the file is plaintext, and another process running as the same user can read it. The OS keychain is the right answer and a native dependency per platform; this is strictly better than a browser storage entry and no better than that.

**Which store a credential belongs in** is decided by one question, and the two stores exist to answer it differently: **does the webview have to send this credential itself?** The GitHub token does not — only the launcher's sign-in flow touches it — so it lives in `credentials.json` and the webview is never handed it. The AI provider key does: the browser sends it as `X-Api-Key` on every request to the proxy, so withholding it from the webview and then transmitting it from the webview would be the same trust boundary with more moving parts. It therefore stays in the settings store. Both files are written owner-only, so the property that actually protects a credential at rest — a copied profile, a backup, another account on the machine — does not depend on which one it is in.

## 4. Project Loading

### 4.1 The project.json Contract

A project is identified by its `project.json` file. This is the single point of entry for all deployment targets:

- **Desktop:** User selects `project.json` via native file dialog. The parent directory becomes the project root.
- **Dev server:** User selects the folder containing `project.json` via `showDirectoryPicker()`. Studio reads `project.json` from the directory to validate it.
- **Cloud:** User picks from a repository list (`openProjectPicker: "repo-list"` — GitHub repositories with write access, Jx-tagged repos first). Selection runs `importProject`, which probes the repository's `project.json` and resolves the catalogue root key Studio navigates to.

What that list contains is bounded by the App's grant, not by the account's repositories, so the picker (both modes — Open Project and Add Existing Repository) also renders a **repository-access footer** built from `getAccountStatus()`:

| Affordance                | Source                      | Effect                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| One link per installation | `installations[].manageUrl` | Opens that installation's repository-access settings on GitHub (new tab)      |
| "Another account…"        | `appInstallUrl`             | Installs the App on an account that has none                                  |
| Refresh                   | —                           | Re-runs `listRepos` + `getAccountStatus` in place, without closing the dialog |

The footer is omitted entirely when the status is unknown or nothing is linkable (a platform without `getAccountStatus`, a failed hydrate, or installations that report no `manageUrl` and no install URL) — Studio never renders a dead access link.

The `project.json` file is **required** for project-level features. Studio can still open individual `.json` files for standalone component editing (see §4.3).

### 4.2 Project Open Flow

```
User clicks "Open Project"
        │

### 4.2a Where the Project Opens

> **Status: Implemented.**

A window holds one project, so opening another is a question with two answers, and Studio asks it whenever both are available: **This Window** or **New Window**, with the open project named in the prompt.

**The question is only asked where it can be honoured.** That takes two PAL members, not one:

| Member                   | What it provides                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `openProjectInNewWindow` | Somewhere else to open into                                                   |
| `pickProject`            | An answer to _which project_ that does not bind **this** window to the answer |

`openProject()` picks **and binds** — the platform re-roots the calling window's session as part of presenting its dialog. That is correct for This Window and unusable for New Window, where the asking window must be left exactly as it was. A platform with only `openProjectInNewWindow` cannot carry out either answer faithfully, so no choice is offered and Open Project behaves as it does with one window.

```
"New Window"
        │
        ▼
platform.pickProject()            → { root, name } | null   (binds nothing, anywhere)
        │                              │
        │                              └── null (cancelled): nothing opens, nothing is reported
        ▼
platform.openProjectInNewWindow(root)
        │
        ▼
Returns { focused }
        │
        ├─── focused: false — a window was created for the project; it loads the project itself
        │    and adds its own recent-projects entry
        │
        └─── focused: true — a window already had this project and was raised instead
        ▼
Studio reports what happened. The asking window's project, tabs and backend binding are untouched
on every branch above.
```

**The outcome is reported, never the intent.** The three results — opened here, opened in a new window, raised an existing window — are distinguishable, and a cancelled picker is silent. Announcing the chosen target instead produces reports of things that did not happen: "Opening the project in a new window…" over a dismissed file dialog, or over a window that merely came to the front.

**An empty window is its own verb.** `newWindow` opens a welcome window with no project, and it is the `view.newWindow` command (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+N`, gated on the same multi-window capability every member above is) — not a menu item. It was a menu item, and only ElectroBun's native application menu had it, so on a launcher whose window has no menu bar the member existed on the platform and could not be run. The native menu keeps the item and **claims no accelerator**: a chord with two owners fires twice, which is two welcome windows from one press.

### 4.3 Single File Mode

> **Status: Pending.** Current builds have no user-facing entry point into standalone single-file editing — Studio always opens a project (`project.json`), and documents open inside that project context. The `build.format: "single"` project option is reserved for this workflow but currently unused. The behavior below is the design target.

When a user opens an individual `.json` file (via "Open File" or by double-clicking in an already-open project tree), Studio enters **single file mode**:

- The canvas loads the document as a standalone component
- No project tree is shown (unless a project is already open)
- Components sidebar shows only components declared or imported by this file (see §6.1)
- File operations (save, etc.) operate on the individual file

Single file mode is the default when no project is loaded. It is also active within a project when editing an individual component — but the project context remains available.

### 4.4 State Shape

```javascript
// After opening a project:
projectState = {
  root: "/Users/alice/Sites/my-site", // Absolute path (local) or project ID (cloud)
  name: "My Site", // From project.json
  projectRoot: ".", // Relative path prefix for API calls
  isSiteProject: true,
  projectConfig: {/* parsed project.json */},
  dirs: new Map(), // Cached directory listings
  expanded: new Set(), // Expanded tree nodes
  selectedPath: null,
  searchQuery: "",
};
```

### 4.5 Project Create Flow

> **Status: Implemented.**

A new project is written **only** where the user said to put it. No backend picks a destination on its own, and none falls back to its own root — an unspecified destination is an error, not a default.

**The wizard is two steps, and the second collects identity only.** Step 1 (_Choose a starting point_) offers the starter gallery — with one **Start from scratch** card at its end for the minimal scaffold — plus the Import and Agent sources on their own tabs. Step 2 (_Name your project_) collects the project name and the destination, and nothing else: the site's URL, its deployment adapter and its design tokens are project settings, editable for the life of the project, so they are not creation-time decisions. **Cancel is available on both steps**, alongside the underlay, `Escape` and the header close button.

`StudioPlatform.createDestination` declares which kind of destination the platform takes, and the New Project modal renders the matching fields on its Name step:

| `createDestination` | Platforms           | Fields collected                            | `createProject({ destination })`                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `"path"`            | Desktop, dev server | **Location** (absolute parent), folder name | `{ kind: "path", parent }` → project at `parent/<directory>` |
| `"repo"`            | Cloud               | **Owner**, **Repository**, **Visibility**   | `{ kind: "repo", owner, repo, private }`                     |

```

             created under the chosen account, never a server-side default
        ▼
Returns { root, config } and the modal opens it
```

A live preview under the fields shows the resolved destination (`/home/you/Sites/my-site`, or `acme/my-site`) before anything is written.

**Every created project is a git repository.** A scaffold that is not under version control has no undo for its first destructive action, and nothing in the app says so. On the create path — every source, including Import and Agent — Studio therefore binds the backend to the new root (`activate`), reads `gitStatus`, and runs `gitInit` when the tree is not already a repository. It is skipped entirely on `createDestination: "repo"` platforms, where the project _is_ a repository by construction, and a git failure is reported without failing the create: the project that was written stays written.

**The obligation belongs to whatever creates the project, not to the wizard.** The assistant's bootstrap tools create projects too, and for a release only the wizard was keeping this promise — a project the agent scaffolded was not a repository and nothing said so. Both tools now run the same adoption sequence: version control, then the open flow, then a check that the workspace really moved, because the adopter reports its failures rather than raising them and a resolved promise is not proof of adoption.

**Import shares this destination, and hands it to the assistant.** The Import tab is one of the three New Project sources, so it collects the same Location field; the resolved absolute path reaches the backend as `ImportSiteOptions.directory`, and a relative directory arriving there means a caller skipped the field and is refused. The wizard no longer runs the pipeline: it gathers the URL, the crawl options, a model and a brief, then closes without having created anything, and the assistant runs the import as a tool call (`specs/ai.md` §3.5). That is what makes the run watchable and questionable — the wizard's progress log was destroyed at the moment a successful import handed off, taking every phase line and every warning with it. **Stop in the assistant aborts the run**, in place of the wizard's Cancel Import.

**How many breakpoints the project keeps is a decision the wizard makes explicit.** A real site declares as many as it has accumulated frameworks — nine is ordinary — and the importer used to keep every one, so an imported project opened with nine canvas sizes and nine columns in every style editor. Nobody authors against nine, and nobody chose these nine. The Import tab therefore offers three answers: keep a COUNT of them, evenly spaced across the widths the site declares (three by default); name the WIDTHS the project should have; or keep every one. The first two carry a rounding rule — nearest, down, or up — because it decides which DECLARED width backs a kept one, and the styles flip where the site says they do rather than where the author wishes they did. A width that is not kept is FOLDED into the kept one nearest it, so nothing the site expressed is discarded silently, and the run says which widths went where.

**What the import emits is a Jx project, not a transcription of the source.** Seven consequences are normative, and each was a defect before it was a rule:

- **The emitted `project.json` validates against the project's own generated schema.** That document closes its composition with `unevaluatedProperties: false` (extensions.md §5.2), so a key the core fragment does not declare is not a harmless extra — it fails the file, and Studio's Contexts editor validates the whole configuration before saving, which made the base width of an imported site uneditable. A description belongs in `$head`, where `@jxsuite/create` writes it and a browser reads it.
- **The source site's classes do not reach disk.** Every visual fact the pipeline emits comes from computed style, and the only CSS it writes is the `@font-face` rules it recovered; the original stylesheets are never emitted. A `class` attribute that survives therefore names rules that do not exist, in every page, layout and component a reader then edits around — and a class that happens to differ between two instances of one block would otherwise become a component prop nobody chose. The strip runs last, after componentization and after any AI naming pass, both of which legitimately read those names to choose a better one. This is not a claim that Jx is classless: `className` remains a first-class element property (`specs/spec.md` §8.1) and the compiler still emits generated classes for nested style rules (§9.2).
- **One file per responsive image family reaches disk.** A CMS publishes one photograph as a ladder of derivatives — WordPress alone writes `-300x200`, `-768x512`, `-1536x1025` and `-scaled` beside the upload — and every rung appears in the `srcset` of every `<img>` that uses it. Enqueuing each candidate independently made a clone of a 451-image site download 2,446 files, and carried a `srcset` the compiler did not build and cannot reason about into the emitted markup, where an `<img src>` pointing at a derivative is a permanent quality CEILING rather than merely a wasted byte. The importer keeps the largest member the page actually referenced, aliases every dropped rung onto it so no reference is left unresolved, and deletes the now-redundant `srcset` and `sizes`. The winner is always a URL that was seen: synthesising the undecorated name would 404 on the many families a CMS serves only in scaled form, and a failed download leaves the REMOTE url in the markup, so the clone would serve that image from the site it cloned.
- **An interaction the pipeline can read becomes native markup; one it cannot is left alone.** A site drives its widgets with a client framework, the capture strips scripts, and what survives is directives nothing will execute over content frozen in whatever state it was captured in — an accordion whose rows can never open again, with its text still on disk and unreachable. Two readings are available and neither names a framework. The first is the ATTRIBUTE VALUES themselves, read as an algebra — a state declaration, a toggle over one key, a predicate against the same key — which recognises an accordion whatever the directives are called; where that algebra closes over the repeated rows, an exclusive accordion becomes `<details>` sharing a `name`, reproducing the source's single-scalar state exactly with no runtime and nothing left to wire wrong. The second is the ACCESSIBILITY CONTRACT a site already ships, `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` and `aria-haspopup` and the id links beside them, which pairs a control with the panel it opens and which every framework spells identically. What that pair becomes is decided by the FLOW, not by the vocabulary: a concealed panel still in the flow is content that belongs where it sits and is simply not shown yet, so it becomes `<details>` with the control's label as its `<summary>`; a concealed panel lifted OUT of the flow is drawn on top of the page, so it becomes a popover, its invoker gains `popovertarget`, and the closed state moves out of the base rule into `:popover-open` — a distinction that is not stylistic, because the UA sheet closes a popover from UA origin and any author `display` left in the base rule beats it, laying the panel out whether open or not. Concealment alone never qualifies a panel: a responsive alternate and a closed accordion row are hidden too, and mistaking either for an overlay staples it permanently over the page. Every original node is MOVED rather than rebuilt, and the rewrite is abandoned whole if a single text run or image would go missing — a stale widget is a far smaller defect than deleted content. An element whose semantics live in its tag is never promoted to a component root, because a component template root takes the component's own tag name and would hand back an inert custom element. An invoker is likewise only ever a `<button>` or an `<input>`, the two interfaces HTML gives the popover-target attributes to: an anchor that is really a button becomes one, and an anchor that genuinely navigates is left unconverted, because a dead link is a worse defect than a menu that did not modernise.
- **A measured size is not an authored one, and only authored sizes are emitted.** `getComputedStyle` returns used values, so `width` is the pixels an element happens to occupy rather than the `100%` or `auto` that produced them. Written down unconditionally that PINS the layout: a full-width section captured at 1440px never fills anything else again, which is what a reader sees the moment a canvas is wider than the width the import was taken at. The test is structural rather than numerical, because a numerical one cannot work: a container with `max-width: 1390px` measures 1390 at every width in its own media band, so any second sample agrees with it. A block-level box in normal flow fills its containing block BY DEFINITION, so its measured `width` states a fact the layout already implies and the constraint that narrowed it (`max-width`, `flex-basis`, a grid track) is captured separately and survives; the measurement is therefore dropped and the fluidity comes back. A replaced element, an out-of-flow box and a shrink-to-fit inline box are each sized by something the layout does NOT imply, so theirs are kept. `height` is judged once more against content: a box with content is as tall as its content and pinning it breaks as soon as text reflows, while an EMPTY box's height is its whole purpose and nothing else in the document would reproduce it.
- **A breakpoint's styles are what the site declared there, not what the viewport measured.** `getComputedStyle` returns used values, so a fluid element reports the pixels it happens to occupy and every one of them differs from the base capture. Sampling once per breakpoint therefore recorded the viewport's own width as the element's: two thirds of a real import's responsive declarations, which do not merely waste space but PIN the layout the breakpoint existed to reflow. Each kept breakpoint is sampled twice within its own band — downward for `max-width`, upward for `min-width`, or the second sample leaves the band it is meant to characterise — and only declarations both samples agree on are emitted. A property that reverts to its element's default at a breakpoint is a change like any other and is emitted with the value measured there; iterating only the breakpoint's own surviving declarations made `display: flex` returning to `block` invisible, which is most of what "stack on mobile" means.
- **Downloaded assets are referenced the way an author would write them.** `public/` is served from the site root, so a file at `public/assets/images/hero.jpg` is referenced `/assets/images/hero.jpg`. A reference without a leading slash resolves against the referencing DOCUMENT's directory, so emitting the file path made every imported image resolve to a path under `pages/` — broken on the canvas and in the build alike.

## 5. Backend API Contract

> **Status: Implemented.** Both halves are specified. The route table is canonical and complete, and the failure shape is RFC 9457 `application/problem+json` from the `PROBLEM_TYPES` registry in `@jxsuite/protocol` — one table, generated into the docs beside the routes, so a backend implementer reads the failure vocabulary in the same breath as the success one. `server.md` §4.3 holds the reasoning, including the three surfaces that deliberately stay 200.

The Backend API Contract defines the operations that any Studio backend must support. The current `@jxsuite/server` endpoints map directly to these operations. Other backends (ElectroBun Bun process, cloud API) implement the same operations through their own transport.

### 5.1 Canonical Route Table

The canonical, complete list of backend operations is the `STUDIO_ROUTES` table in `packages/protocol/src/routes.ts` — roughly 60 routes, each carrying its method, literal dev-server path, core-vs-optional flag, one-line contract summary, and (for optional routes) a `degradation` note. A generated human-readable reference is published in the docs (`docs/extending/embedding/backend-protocol.md`). This spec no longer duplicates the table.

Conventions:

- Paths are the dev server's literal `/__studio/*` endpoints; transport-mapped backends (RPC bridges, gateway prefixes) preserve the sub-path and the request/response shapes, which live in `@jxsuite/protocol` alongside the table.
- `STUDIO_PROTOCOL_VERSION` bumps when a route's shape changes incompatibly.
- File search has no dedicated endpoint: `GET /__studio/files?glob=<pattern>` searches matching files project-wide (the same route that lists a directory with `?dir=`), backing `searchFiles()`.
- Both listing shapes answer in **stable path order**, sorted by codepoint rather than locale collation so two backends agree. `readdir` and glob scans report in filesystem order, which varies with a directory's write history, and Studio's collection grid inserts rows in listing order — so an unsorted listing reaches the user as a table that reshuffles itself between opens.

A few illustrative rows (see the table for the rest):

| Operation           | `@jxsuite/server` endpoint      | PAL method                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| List directory      | `GET /__studio/files?dir=`      | `listDirectory(dir)`       |
| Search contents     | `GET /__studio/files?glob=`     | `searchFiles(query, exts)` |
| Read file           | `GET /__studio/file?path=`      | `readFile(path)`           |
| Write file          | `PUT /__studio/file?path=`      | `writeFile(path, content)` |
| Rename file         | `POST /__studio/file/rename`    | `renameFile(from, to)`     |
| Find references     | `GET /__studio/references`      | `findReferences(target)?`  |
| Discover components | `GET /__studio/components?dir=` | `discoverComponents(dir)`  |
| Realtime co-editing | `GET /__studio/collab` (WS)     | `collab(docPath)`          |

### 5.2 Project Operations

| Operation        | `@jxsuite/server` endpoint       | PAL method                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Open project     | N/A (client-side dialog)         | `openProject()`                         |
| Project metadata | `GET /__studio/project`          | Derived from `ProjectHandle`            |
| Create project   | `POST /__studio/create-project`  | `createProject({ destination })` (§4.5) |
| Pick a folder    | `GET /__studio/locate-directory` | `pickDirectory?()` (§8.2.1)             |

### 5.3 Code Services

| Operation   | `@jxsuite/server` endpoint   | PAL method                       |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Format code | `POST /__studio/code/format` | `codeService("format", payload)` |
| Lint code   | `POST /__studio/code/lint`   | `codeService("lint", payload)`   |
| Minify code | `POST /__studio/code/minify` | `codeService("minify", payload)` |

`codeService(action, payload)` is a **required** member of the real interface, but it is null-returning: platforms without server-side code tooling implement it as a stub that resolves `null`, and callers treat a null result as "no service available" (editors skip format-on-open/save and show no lint markers). The three routes are correspondingly optional in `STUDIO_ROUTES`, with those degradations recorded on each entry.

### 5.4 Runtime Services

| Operation               | `@jxsuite/server` endpoint | Caller                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Resolve $prototype/$src | `POST /__jx_resolve__`     | The runtime (direct POST) |
| Execute server function | `POST /__jx_server__`      | The runtime (direct POST) |

These are **not** PAL methods — the runtime POSTs to `/__jx_resolve__` and `/__jx_server__` directly, on every platform. The dev server and the loopback project server (which token-gates them) serve the routes as plain HTTP. In the ElectroBun shell there is no HTTP backend for the webview, so the desktop adapter bridges them by patching `window.fetch` (`packages/desktop/src/platform.ts`): POSTs to those two paths are intercepted and forwarded over RPC to the Bun process (`jxResolve` / `jxServerFunction` handlers), and every other request falls through to the original fetch. The only PAL member in this area is the optional `resolveClass?`, which **Studio itself** (not the runtime) uses to resolve class-prototype configs through the same `/__jx_resolve__` pipeline (e.g. the pane context bar's route-param picker, in its "resolving with" popover).

Optional PAL members may not exist on all platforms. Studio feature-detects them by presence before calling:

```javascript
const platform = getPlatform();
if (platform.collab) {
  const handle = await platform.collab(docPath);
}
```

## 6. Component Scoping

The Components sidebar adapts its contents based on context: what is currently open and whether a site project is loaded.

### 6.1 Single File Mode (No Project)

When editing a standalone component with no project loaded:

- **Shown:** Components declared in the file's `$defs`, plus components referenced via `$ref` or custom element `tagName` that resolve to other `.json` files
- **Not shown:** A global component scan. There is no project root to scan.

The component list is derived by walking the document tree and extracting:

1. `$defs` entries that define reusable sub-components
2. `$ref` paths that point to other `.json` files (these are the "imported" components)
3. Custom element `tagName` values that match known component files

### 6.2 Site Project Mode (Root Level)

When a project is loaded and the user is at the project level (e.g. in the file tree, or no specific document is open):

- **Shown:** All components discovered across the entire site (`components/`, co-located `_prefixed` files, any `.json` with a custom-element `tagName`)
- **Scope label:** "All Components" or the site name

### 6.3 Site Project Mode (Document Level)

When a project is loaded and the user opens a specific page, layout, or component:

| Section    | Contents                                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Active** | Components directly referenced by the current document (same logic as §6.1)           |
| **Global** | All other components in the project that are _not_ referenced by the current document |

This two-tier separation lets the user quickly find components already in use ("Active") while still having access to the full project library ("Global") for drag-and-drop insertion.

### 6.4 Resolution Logic

```
openDocument(doc, projectState):

  activeComponents = extractReferences(doc)
    // Walk doc tree, collect $ref paths, custom tagNames, $defs

  if projectState?.isSiteProject:
    allComponents = platform.discoverComponents()
    globalComponents = allComponents.filter(c => !activeComponents.includes(c))
    render:
      "Active" section  → activeComponents
      "Global" section  → globalComponents
  else:
    render:
      flat list → activeComponents
```

### 6.5 Updating on Navigation

When the user navigates into a sub-component (via `pushDocument()` in the state model), the "Active" set updates to reflect the new document's references. The "Global" set adjusts accordingly. When the user navigates back (`popDocument()`), the previous scope is restored.

```

The Bun process owns all filesystem and OS operations. The webview contains Studio's UI. Communication happens via ElectroBun's RPC bridge.

**Toolchain boundary (ElectroBun 2).** Build orchestration belongs to **Hutch**, ElectroBun's build CLI, but nothing installs it by hand: the `electrobun` devDependency is a dependency-free bootstrap whose version selects the whole toolchain — it downloads the paired Hutch, verifies it against the release's published digest, and caches it. Hutch, Cottontail and ElectroBun therefore all ride the workspace lockfile, and a machine-wide Hutch is only a fallback. `electrobun.config.ts` describes the application and the build Hutch produces; `hutch.config.ts` only names tasks. ElectroBun 2 publishes no SDK to npm — `electrobun prepare` copies the release's SDK out of its platform core archive into a generated, gitignored `.hutch/devkit` sysroot, and that is what a BUILD resolves `electrobun/*` from. `electrobun/main` is the runtime-neutral main-process namespace (`electrobun/bun` remains a deprecated alias); `electrobun/view` is unchanged.

**Typechecking resolves elsewhere, and must.** A projection is a network download, so nothing a clone, an editor or a CI job can do on its own produces one — and the npm package resolves every specifier, types included, to a module that throws. Typechecking therefore reads the SDK's TypeScript sources out of `vendor/electrobun`, a git submodule pinned to the exact release the `electrobun` devDependency names, which `packages/desktop/tsconfig.json` maps `electrobun/*` into directly.

The two sysroots are one release, not two sources of truth: the projected devkit is a verbatim copy of the same directories the submodule carries. `bun run electrobun:verify` asserts that the submodule and the version pin agree and fails when they do not, which is the check that keeps a dependency bump from moving one without the other. It compares versions rather than bytes deliberately — an upstream release artifact and its git tag may differ in ways that carry no type surface, and policing that is not this repository's job.

ElectroBun 2 defaults its main process to Cottontail. Jx Studio selects `build.mainProcess: "bun"` explicitly, because the main-process module graph is Bun-native throughout — `Bun.serve`, `Bun.$`, `Bun.spawn`, `Bun.Glob`. Hutch itself runs project TypeScript with Cottontail regardless, so the `preBuild` and `postBuild` hook scripts stay on portable APIs rather than Bun's shell.

### 7.2 Desktop Platform Adapter

The desktop platform adapter runs in the **webview** and translates PAL calls into RPC calls to the Bun process:

```javascript
// packages/studio-desktop/platform.js (runs in webview)
export function createDesktopPlatform() {
  return {
    id: "desktop",

    async openProject() {
      // RPC to Bun process → Utils.openFileDialog()
      const result = await rpc.openProject();
      if (!result) return null;
      return { config: result.config, handle: result.handle };
    },

    async listDirectory(dir) {
      return rpc.listDirectory(dir);
    },

    async readFile(path) {
      return rpc.readFile(path);
    },

    async writeFile(path, content) {
      return rpc.writeFile(path, content);
    },

    // ... etc
  };
}
```

### 7.3 Bun-Side Handlers

The Bun process implements the actual operations:

```javascript
// src/bun/studio-handlers.js (runs in Bun process)
import { Utils } from "electrobun/main";
import { readdir, readFile, writeFile, unlink, rename, stat } from "fs/promises";
import { resolve, relative, join, basename } from "path";

let projectRoot = null;

export async function handleOpenProject() {
  const paths = await Utils.openFileDialog({
    startingFolder: projectRoot || homedir(),
    allowedFileTypes: "json",
    canChooseFiles: true,
    canChooseDirectory: false,
    allowsMultipleSelection: false,
  });

  if (!paths || paths.length === 0) return null;

  const filePath = paths[0];
  if (basename(filePath) !== "project.json") return null;

  const raw = await readFile(filePath, "utf8");
  const config = JSON.parse(raw);
  projectRoot = resolve(filePath, "..");

  return {
    config,
    handle: {
      root: projectRoot,
      name: config.name || basename(projectRoot),
      projectConfig: config,
    },
  };
}

export async function handleListDirectory(dir) {
  const absDir = resolve(projectRoot, dir);
  assertUnderRoot(absDir, projectRoot);
  const entries = await readdir(absDir, { withFileTypes: true });
  return entries.map((e) => ({
    name: e.name,
    path: relative(projectRoot, join(absDir, e.name)),
    type: e.isDirectory() ? "directory" : "file",
  }));
}

// ... readFile, writeFile, deleteFile, renameFile, discoverComponents
```

### 7.4 App Structure

```
jx-studio-app/
├── hutch.config.ts              # Project task names only (the npm dep selects the toolchain)

├── package.json
├── .hutch/devkit/               # Generated: the pinned release's SDK, where a BUILD resolves electrobun/*

    ├── @jxsuite/studio/           # UI package (the studio itself)
    └── @jxsuite/runtime/          # Canvas rendering
```

`.hutch/devkit` is written by Hutch and gitignored — never edited or committed. The `electrobun` package under `node_modules` carries neither runtime nor SDK: it is the bootstrap that resolves and invokes the paired Hutch, which is why it belongs in `devDependencies` rather than `dependencies`.

Typechecking resolves from the repository root instead, out of a sibling of this package:

```
vendor/electrobun/            # Submodule, pinned to the release the electrobun pin names
└── package/src/              # The SDK's TypeScript sources, where TYPECHECKING resolves electrobun/*
```

**Distribution names.** A stable build's INSTALLER carries no channel prefix (`macos-arm64-JxStudio.dmg`), while its updater metadata and update archive keep one (`stable-macos-arm64-update.json`) — the same feed name ElectroBun 1.x used, so an installed 1.x app still finds its updates. ElectroBun 2 publishes no macOS x64 core archive, so that target is not built.

**Packaged static data.** In a packaged build, ElectroBun inlines the whole bun-side JS graph into `app/bun/index.js`, so `import.meta.dirname` in every inlined module resolves to `app/bun/` at runtime. Static data directories read relative to it — `@jxsuite/create`'s `template/` and `templates/`, and `@jxsuite/starters`' `registry.json` and `sites/` — must therefore be staged to those exact paths by `build.copy` in `electrobun.config.ts`. The `postBuild` hook verifies the staged bundle (including the studio view assets) and fails the build on any omission.

---

## 8. Chrome Development Mode

During Studio's own development, the studio runs in Chrome served by `@jxsuite/server`. This is the current workflow and must remain fully functional.

### 8.1 Dev Server Platform Adapter

```javascript
// packages/studio/platforms/devserver.js
export function createDevServerPlatform() {
  return {
    id: "devserver",

    async openProject() {
      // Use Chrome's showDirectoryPicker API
      if (!("showDirectoryPicker" in window)) {
        throw new Error("showDirectoryPicker not available");
      }

      const dirHandle = await window.showDirectoryPicker({ mode: "readwrite" });

      // Read project.json from the chosen directory
      let siteHandle;
      try {
        siteHandle = await dirHandle.getFileHandle("project.json");
      } catch {
        throw new Error("No project.json found in selected folder");
      }

      const file = await siteHandle.getFile();
      const config = JSON.parse(await file.text());

      // Resolve server-relative path by matching against known sites
      const sitesRes = await fetch("/__studio/sites");
      const sites = await sitesRes.json();
      const match = sites.find((s) => JSON.stringify(s.config) === JSON.stringify(config));

      if (!match) {
        throw new Error("Selected project is not under the dev server root");
      }

      return {
        config,
        handle: {
          root: match.path,
          name: config.name || match.path.split("/").pop(),
          projectConfig: config,
        },
      };
    },

    async listDirectory(dir) {
      const serverDir = projectPath(dir);
      const res = await fetch(`/__studio/files?dir=${encodeURIComponent(serverDir)}`);
      if (!res.ok) throw new Error("Failed to list directory");
      const entries = await res.json();
      for (const e of entries) e.path = stripProjectRoot(e.path);
      return entries;
    },

    async readFile(path) {
      const res = await fetch(`/__studio/file?path=${encodeURIComponent(projectPath(path))}`);
      if (!res.ok) throw new Error("Failed to read file");
      return res.text();
    },

    async writeFile(path, content) {
      const res = await fetch(`/__studio/file?path=${encodeURIComponent(projectPath(path))}`, {
        method: "PUT",
        body: content,
      });
      if (!res.ok) throw new Error("Failed to write file");
    },

    // ... deleteFile, renameFile, discoverComponents, codeService, etc.
  };
}
```

### 8.2 Why showDirectoryPicker, Not showOpenFilePicker

In Chrome, `showOpenFilePicker` returns a `FileSystemFileHandle` with no way to access the parent directory or derive a filesystem path. The dev server needs a server-relative path to scope file operations. `showDirectoryPicker` solves this by:

1. Giving the user a folder selection experience (they pick the project folder)
2. Letting Studio read `project.json` from the `FileSystemDirectoryHandle` to validate
3. Matching against the server's `/__studio/sites` endpoint to resolve the server-relative path

For the **desktop app**, `Utils.openFileDialog` with `canChooseFiles: true` and `allowedFileTypes: "json"` gives us the file path directly, so the user can pick `project.json` explicitly.

#### 8.2.1 Picking a destination folder

> **Status: Implemented.**

Choosing where a **new** project goes (§4.5) cannot use any of the three steps above: the folder is empty by definition, so there is no `project.json` to read and nothing for `/__studio/sites` to match. The handle still carries no path.

**This applies only to the plain dev-server browser session.** Every packaged build already has a real native folder dialog that returns a filesystem path directly, and keeps it — electrobun uses `Utils.openFileDialog`, and the NixOS chromium build uses the XDG desktop portal. A browser page has no such option, so it gets the fallback below rather than no **Browse…** button at all.

There, the handle is made to identify itself. Using the `readwrite` grant the picker just issued, `pickDirectoryPath` (`@jxsuite/studio/directory-picker`) tags the folder with a hidden `LOCATION_ID_FILE` — `.jx-loc-id`, defined in `@jxsuite/protocol` because the writer and the reader must agree on it — whose **contents** are a freshly generated 128-bit id, and asks the backend which directory carries that id:

```
Browse… (user gesture)
  → showDirectoryPicker({ id: "jx-new-project-location", mode: "readwrite" })
  → write <random 32-hex id> into <picked>/.jx-loc-id
  → GET /__studio/locate-directory?name=&id=
      ($HOME/.jx-loc-id holds the id → $HOME; else scan **/<name>/.jx-loc-id under $HOME)
      → on match: delete the tag, return the directory
  → finally: handle.removeEntry(".jx-loc-id")
```

**Identity is in the contents, not the filename.** A candidate whose `.jx-loc-id` does not hold this exact id is skipped, so neither a second folder sharing the basename nor a tag left behind by a crashed session can redirect a create — a fixed filename plus a content match is exact where a path shape is only probable. `name` still narrows the scan the way `/__studio/find-project` does. The backend deletes the winning tag as soon as it has served its purpose, and the client removes it too, so nothing is left in the user's new project folder on any path.

Every failure — no API, cancel, a read-only grant, a folder the backend cannot place — resolves `null`, which the modal treats identically to "no folder chosen" and leaves the Location field untouched. On a browser without the File System Access API the dev-server adapter omits `pickDirectory` entirely, so the button is hidden rather than dead, and the Location field is typed.

---

## 9. NixOS Chromium App-Mode

> **Status: Implemented.** Available via `nix build` and `bun run desktop:chromium`.

On NixOS, ElectroBun cannot be built in a Nix sandbox, and system Chromium provides superior Wayland support. The desktop app therefore uses Chromium in `--app` mode, which provides a frameless, app-like window.

### 9.1 Architecture

               ▼
      ┌────────────────────┐
      │  window registry   │  ← every other launcher on this machine
      └────────────────────┘
```

The backend is `createProjectServer()` from `@jxsuite/server` — the same loopback-bound factory each ElectroBun window stands up (§7.1), with the same token gate, the same `/__studio__/` asset namespace and the same WS-RPC dispatch. It is **not** the dev server, and Studio does **not** register the dev-server adapter: `packages/desktop/src/chromium/platform.ts` is this launcher's own PAL implementation, translating each member into a WS request against `chromium/index.ts`'s handler map. `packages/desktop/tests/_rpc-parity.ts` reads the request names back out of `rpc-schema.ts` and fails when either launcher declares one it does not answer.

The WS carries traffic in both directions. Frames with an `id` answer something the shell asked; frames with a `method` and **no** `id` are the launcher speaking first (`ProjectServerHandle.push`), which is how filesystem events reach the sidebar and how a focus request reaches a window.

### 9.2 Launcher (`chromium/index.ts`)

The entry point performs, in order:

1. Resolves the project root: the first positional argument, else `JSONSX_PROJECT_ROOT`, else the working directory **but only when it holds a `project.json`** — unless `JX_STUDIO_NO_PROJECT` marks it a welcome window (§9.4). A root that was named is taken at its word; the one nobody typed has to prove itself, because the launcher is also started from a desktop entry and from a shell sitting anywhere. Adopting a directory that is not a project bought nothing — the shell shows the welcome screen either way, since `probeRootProject` reads the same `project.json` — and cost a recursive filesystem watch of, in the reported case, the whole home directory (what such a watcher will and will not descend into is `server.md` §3.1)
2. **Raises an existing window instead of opening a second one** for a project already open (§9.4)
3. Locates a Chromium binary via `CHROMIUM_BIN` or PATH (`chromium`, `chromium-browser`, `google-chrome`, `google-chrome-stable`); this binary is also the import pipeline's browser
4. Starts `createProjectServer()` on an ephemeral loopback port, and hosts the sign-in redirect on it
5. Points the session's filesystem-event sink at the server's push channel, so the sidebar is live. **Registering the sink is what starts the watcher, and the session watches a project or nothing at all:** with no `project.json` at the root it logs one line and declines, because that is the same root `probeRootProject` reports as "no project" — a recursive watch of it would be a scan of a user's directory tree on behalf of a project the window is not showing. Nothing is lost by waiting, since every way a project can arrive (`openProject`, `createProject`, `setWindowProject`) re-roots the session and arms the watcher then
6. Publishes itself in the window registry and starts watching for focus requests
7. Launches Chromium with app-mode flags:
   - `--app=<serverUrl>/__studio__/index.html?token=<rpcToken>` — frameless window, gated surface
   - `--no-first-run --no-default-browser-check` — suppress first-run prompts
   - `--window-size=1400,900`
   - `--user-data-dir=<profile>` — this window's profile (§9.4)
   - `--ozone-platform=wayland --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform` — when `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` is set
8. Leaves the registry and exits when the browser window closes

### 9.3 Nix Package

The flake's `packages.default` produces a fully sandboxed NixOS package:

- **Build dependencies** are fetched via [bun2nix](https://github.com/nix-community/bun2nix), which generates a `bun.nix` lockfile mapping all packages to fixed-output derivations — no network access needed during build
- **`bun.nix` auto-refresh:** The root `package.json` postinstall script runs `bun2nix -o bun.nix` after every `bun install`, keeping the nix lockfile in sync with `bun.lock`
- **Build phase** runs `bun run build` (compiler, runtime, studio, schema) and `pre-build.ts` (bundles the studio init bridge and copies assets)
- **Install phase** copies `packages/`, `extensions/` and `node_modules` into the nix store with plain `cp -r`, then deletes dangling symlinks (`find … -xtype l -delete`) rather than dereferencing with `cp -rL`. The prune is why `packages/desktop/tests/nix-bundle-completeness.test.ts` exists: it reads the copied directories back out of `package.nix` and asserts every `@jxsuite/*` dependency of the desktop app lands under one of them, after `extensions/parser` was once pruned out of the bundle silently
- **Wrapper** creates a `jx-studio` binary that runs `bun run packages/desktop/src/chromium/index.ts` with `CHROMIUM_BIN` and `JX_STUDIO_ASSETS` pre-set to nix store paths. The first positional argument is the **project root**; there is no flag surface

**The desktop entry and the window have to agree.** A taskbar or dock does not read the process, the title or `--class`: it takes the window's Wayland `app_id` (X11: `WM_CLASS`) and looks for an entry claiming it. Two things were in the way, and each hid the other:

- The entry was installed through `desktopItems`, which takes the **store path's basename** — so it shipped as `<hash>-jx-studio.desktop`, an id that changed with every rebuild. It is installed by hand at a fixed name now.
- Chromium derives an `--app` window's id from the shell URL and the profile directory and **ignores `--class`** — measured across two ports and two `--user-data-dir` values, all producing `chrome-127.0.0.1____studio___index.html-Default`, and there is no switch to override it (`--wm-class-name` / `--wm-class-class` are Electron's, and absent from the binary).

So the entry declares that derived string in `StartupWMClass`, which makes a file in `packages/desktop/` depend on a URL composed in `chromium/index.ts`. `chromium/app-id.ts` owns the derivation and the shell path the launcher builds the URL from, and the test beside it asserts the entry carries exactly what the launcher produces — because the failure mode is silent. Nothing errors; the icon is a generic square, and everything else about the app still works, which is why it survived in the app launcher (which reads the file, never the window) while the taskbar showed nothing.

**That is the taskbar/dock icon, and it is a different mechanism from the window's own icon.** A window's title bar and alt-tab thumbnail are not drawn from `StartupWMClass` or the `.desktop` entry at all — a system `chromium --app` process has no native app icon of its own to give them, so Chromium falls back to the loaded page's favicon. `studioShellHtml()` now links one (`STUDIO_FAVICON`, studio.md §11.2), which is what lets the window itself show the Jx icon rather than a generic one; the two icons can drift independently, and fixing one does not touch the other.

**Which ref a consumer gets.** `packages/desktop/package.nix` builds `src = lib.cleanSource ../..` — whatever tree was fetched — so the ref names the release. `main` is the development trunk and gives the tip; **`release` holds only released code**, advanced by CI to each `desktop-v*` tag once that tag has both produced its installers and passed a real `nix build`. A NixOS user therefore pins the branch, not the trunk:

```
$ nix run github:jxsuite/jx/release
$ nix build github:jxsuite/jx/release && ./result/bin/jx-studio [project-root]
```

Locally, `nix build` (no ref) builds the working tree, which is what a contributor wants.

**And the consumer downloads it.** The release publishes `packages.<system>.default` to `https://jxsuite.cachix.org`, and the flake's own `nixConfig` names that cache, so `nix run github:jxsuite/jx/release` fetches the app rather than producing it. What is published is essentially one store path. Everything else in the runtime closure — Chromium, Bun, glibc — is already on `cache.nixos.org`, and any path carrying a cache's signature is filtered out of the push, so what remains is precisely the `bun install` plus `bun run build` a user would otherwise run. Their build-time inputs are never fetched either: Nix does not realise the inputs of a derivation whose output it can substitute, which is why the ~1000 npm tarball derivations `bun.nix` pins do not have to be published for the substitution to be complete.

The push is best-effort by design — a cache is an optimisation, and failing it must not fail the job `release` advances behind, whose worst case is the behaviour that preceded the cache. What is not best-effort is **noticing**. `verify-cache` runs after the branch moves and asks two things of the released ref: does the cache hold the path evaluation produces, and does `nix build --max-jobs 0` — substitute or fail — succeed against `github:jxsuite/jx/release`. Either answering no opens an issue. The second question is also the only check anywhere that the store path CI published is the one a consumer's flake fetch evaluates to; CI builds a git checkout and a user builds a GitHub tarball, and nothing else in the pipeline would notice if those stopped agreeing.

Nix honours a flake's `nixConfig` substituters only for a user in `trusted-users`, so an unprivileged NixOS account ignores the cache and builds from source anyway. That is a property of Nix rather than of this packaging, and the install page carries the `nix.settings` form that survives it.

`release` never advances to a commit whose flake does not build: `.github/workflows/nix.yml` builds `.#default` at the tag and asserts the wrapper's `CHROMIUM_BIN` and `JX_STUDIO_ASSETS` resolve, and the branch moves only if that succeeds. When it does not, the branch stays where it is and an issue is opened — a stale ref that works beats a fresh one that does not. The same workflow runs on any pull request touching `flake.nix`, `bun.nix`, `bun.lock` or `packages/desktop/**`, which is the first time the flake has been built by CI at all.

**Both architectures are built; only one is a gate.** `meta.platforms` has always claimed `aarch64-linux`, and nothing had ever built it — the `forThisHost` filter that trims `bun.nix` to the host's `os`/`cpu` had only been exercised on x86_64. The release therefore runs a second leg on an arm runner, and that leg is **advisory**: it is absent from `advance-release-branch`'s `needs`, because a first-ever aarch64 failure freezing `release` would strand every x86 user over an architecture nobody has received yet. It becomes a gate once it has been green across several releases.

**The workflow also runs on pushes to `main`, and that trigger is about the cache rather than the check.** A GitHub Actions cache is branch-scoped: a pull request may read the default branch's cache, never another pull request's. With no run on `main` there is no base cache to inherit, so each PR would refetch from scratch the roughly one thousand fixed-output npm tarball derivations `bun.nix` pins — the half of the closure `cache.nixos.org` does not carry and never will, because those derivations exist only here. A release-PR merge consequently builds twice, once through the `push` trigger and once through release-please's `workflow_call`; they sit in different concurrency groups, and the `push` leg is what leaves `main` warm for the next PR.

### 9.4 Windows Are Processes

> **Status: Implemented.**

An ElectroBun window is a `BrowserWindow` inside one process, so its window manager is a `Map` (§7.1). Chromium owns its own browser process, and the only thing that lives exactly as long as one `--app` window is the launcher that started it — so **on this build a window is a process**, and `newWindow` / `openProjectInNewWindow` spawn another launcher rather than another object.

That makes the window list the one thing a `Map` cannot be: an answer that spans processes. It is a directory of one small owner-only file per window, named for its pid:

```
<data>/jx-studio/windows/<pid>.json     ← written and deleted by that window, nobody else
<data>/jx-studio/windows/<pid>.focus    ← written by ANOTHER window to ask this one forward
```

**One writer per file is the whole concurrency design.** Nothing read-modify-writes a shared document, so two launchers starting at the same instant cannot lose each other's row, and a launcher that dies without cleaning up leaves a row whose pid no longer resolves — pruned by the next window to read the directory, with no daemon to have missed the death. `JX_STUDIO_WINDOWS_DIR` relocates the store, which is what keeps a test run out of the real user's windows.

**A focus request is a file, not a signal.** A pid the OS has recycled would receive a signal meant for a process that no longer exists, and `SIGUSR2` terminates a process that installed no handler. A file only the real launcher watches for is inert to anyone else. The request is consumed before the window is raised, so a window asked twice comes forward twice.

**Raising is the page's job.** Nothing on the Bun side can bring a Chromium `--app` window forward, so the launcher relays the request to its shell as a `focusWindow` push and the page calls `window.focus()`. A window manager that refuses the raise leaves the window where it is.

**Every window needs a profile directory of its own**, because Chromium's process singleton is keyed on it: two windows sharing one directory would be one browser process, and the second launcher's window would be handed to the first launcher's browser pointing at a server about to die. A project's window uses `<root>/.jx/chromium-profile`, so its Studio layout, theme and open tabs survive a restart; a welcome window has no project to key on and takes the lowest `welcome-<n>` slot no live window is using. The parent chooses the child's directory (`JX_STUDIO_PROFILE_DIR`) because only the parent can see which ones are taken.

**Dedupe is by normalized root** — resolved, symlinks followed, case-folded on Windows — and it applies at three points: launching for a project already open (which raises that window and exits), `openProjectInNewWindow`, and `setWindowProject`. The third excludes the calling window, so re-rooting never dedupes against itself.

### 9.5 What This Build Does Not Implement, and Why

Two PAL families are absent on purpose, and their absence is a claim recorded in `CHROMIUM_RPC_EXEMPT`:

- **The self-updater.** This build is installed and replaced by whatever packaged it. It has no feed to check, so it answers the About screen through `appInfo` — version, channel (`system` when the Nix wrapper's `JX_STUDIO_ASSETS` is set, `development` otherwise), commit — and reports **no** update status rather than an "Up to date" it never verified. ElectroBun answers the same request from its updater, so the About screen has one shape and each launcher fills in only what it knows.
- **Client-side window decorations.** Studio draws minimize/maximize/close only when the launcher exposes `windowControls`, which ElectroBun does because its `BrowserWindow` is frameless. A Chromium `--app` window is decorated by the desktop environment, and a second set of buttons inside the page would minimize and close nothing.

Everything else the ElectroBun launcher implements, this one implements: `previewSite` and the overlay pair behind `View: Open in Browser`, `buildSite` behind `Build Site`, `subscribeFileEvents` behind the live sidebar, `findReferences`, `importSite`, the data and secrets surfaces, the native folder and project pickers (via the XDG desktop portal, §8.2.1), and sign-in (§3.6).

## 10. SaaS / Cloud Mode

> **Status: Partial.** The adapter shipped and is deployed; §10.2's storage model is not what it was built on. This section said **Future** for as long as the cloud editor had been live, which is the failure mode a status marker exists to prevent — so what follows separates what runs from what is still a sketch.

### 10.1 Cloud Platform Adapter

> **Status: Implemented.** `packages/studio/src/platforms/cloud.ts`, registered by the studio entry rather than by the shell — see §3.3 and the `yjs` singleton note there.

A cloud adapter replaces filesystem operations with API calls to a remote service. The project root becomes a project ID rather than a filesystem path. All PAL methods translate to REST or WebSocket calls to the cloud API.

Concretely, the shipped adapter is session-bound: every call goes to `/api/v1/p/:owner/:repo/:branch/studio/*` with cookie auth, so the "project id" is the triple in the path. It reports `id: "cloud"`, `canvasUrl: "/canvas.html"` and `openProjectPicker: "repo-list"` — that last one routes New Project through Studio's own repository picker over `listRepos` + `importProject`, so `openProject()` is never called (§3.4). It implements the full git family, the identity and publish members, `subscribeFileEvents` over SSE, and `collab`. It deliberately omits `pickDirectory`, `importSite`, the package install family, `gitClone`, `resolveClass` and `codeService`; each degrades exactly as its protocol route's `degradation` field describes, which is what makes an omission a documented state rather than a break.

**`discoverComponents` is NOT among them, and the reason it once was is worth keeping.** It returned nothing under a blanket "no execution of project JS" posture — but for a JSON component, discovery is a file read and a property lookup, and executes nothing. The posture belongs to the formats that genuinely need a project-supplied parser, not to the whole feature. Omitting it did not cost a feature list: the canvas injects the `$elements` a document's tags need only when the component registry is non-empty, so an empty registry meant no component was ever registered or fetched, and every instance rendered as an unregistered custom element — blank space where the component should be. An omission is only a documented state when something actually degrades gracefully.

Because a cloud project _is_ a repository, the adapter sets `createDestination: "repo"` and the New Project modal collects a repository location — owner (personal account or organization), repository name, and visibility — instead of a folder (§4.5). The adapter forwards all three to the API, which resolves the owner against the session login to choose between the personal and organization creation endpoints. Nothing about the destination is defaulted server-side.

### 10.2 Storage Backend

> **Status: Partial.** The mapping below is one possible one and not the one that shipped — the deployed backend is **git-backed**, a cloud project IS a repository, which is why the adapter sets `createDestination: "repo"` and carries the whole git family. What IS settled, and what this section now states, is the part a backend must DECLARE rather than the part it may choose.

The cloud backend stores projects in a database with an abstraction equivalent to the filesystem:

| Filesystem concept  | Cloud equivalent                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `project.json`      | Project record with config JSON column |
| Directory listing   | Query files table by parent path       |
| File read/write     | Row-level CRUD on files table          |
| Component discovery | Query files table by naming convention |

The same PAL interface means Studio code doesn't change — only the adapter implementation.

#### What a storage backend MUST declare

Whatever it stores projects in, a backend cannot leave these implicit: none is discoverable from the client, and each one fails silently when guessed.

- **Where a project file is served, and in which URL space.** `documentBaseUrl` plus `assetSpace` (§3.1). A backend whose files are perfectly readable through `readFile` can still be `"repo"` space, because what decides it is what answers `GET /hero.jpg` on the canvas document's origin.
- **Where an upload actually landed.** `uploadFile` answers `UploadResult { path, size? }`, and the `path` is the ANSWER (`studio.md` §9.3). A backend that de-duplicates by content hash, suffixes a collision, or normalizes a name MUST report the path it wrote, or the reference Studio writes into the document names a file that is not there.
- **What it will accept.** `assetCapabilities` — `maxUploadBytes`, `accept`. Optional, and absence means no declared limit; a declared one lets Studio refuse before the round trip and name the number.

A backend that stores bytes MUST return them losslessly. Reading a stored blob through a text decoder is not a display concern: a lenient UTF-8 decode is TOTAL — it answers every input, substituting U+FFFD for each byte it cannot represent, and reports nothing — so a backend that re-encodes what it read destroys the file on the next write that touches it.

### 10.3 Collaboration

> **Status: Implemented**, and not as sketched. The interface below is what this section proposed; the paragraph after it is what shipped. Kept side by side because the difference is the design decision: locks were replaced by convergence.

The sketch was a lock-and-notify model:

```typescript
interface CollaborativePlatform extends StudioPlatform {
  onRemoteChange(callback: (change: FileChange) => void): void;
  lockFile(path: string): Promise<boolean>;
  unlockFile(path: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

What shipped is one optional PAL member — `collab?: (docPath) => Promise<CollabHandle | null>` — over a CRDT (`@jxsuite/collab`, Yjs). There are no locks: two authors edit the same document and the document converges, rather than one of them being refused. The adapter probes `/collab` once and passes the `protocols` the backend lists to the wire client, which offers one as `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`; a client that offers a subprotocol the server does not echo fails the connection outright ([RFC 6455 §4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455#section-4.1)), so an unconditional offer would break co-editing against every backend that predates negotiation.

The member is still additive in the way this section intended: Studio checks for its presence and falls back to solo, file-level saves without it.

## 11. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: PAL Extraction ✅

Extract the platform abstraction from Studio's current inline `fetch()` calls:

- [x] Define `StudioPlatform` interface in `packages/studio/src/platform.js`
- [x] Implement `DevServerPlatform` wrapping current `fetch("/__studio/*")` calls
- [x] Replace all direct `fetch("/__studio/*")` in `studio.js` with `getPlatform().*` calls
- [x] Implement `showDirectoryPicker()` flow in `DevServerPlatform.openProject()`
- [ ] Update component sidebar to implement Active/Global scoping (§6)
- [x] Add `GET /__studio/sites` endpoint for dev server project matching

### Phase 2: Desktop App Skeleton ✅

Package Studio as an ElectroBun app:

- [x] Scaffold ElectroBun project with Studio as the main view
- [x] Implement `DesktopPlatform` adapter (RPC bridge to Bun process)
- [x] Implement Bun-side file handlers (read, write, list, delete, rename, discover)
- [x] Wire `Utils.openFileDialog()` for `openProject()` with `project.json` filter
- [ ] Port code services (format, lint, minify) to run in Bun process directly (currently stubbed)
- [x] Verify full editing flow: open project, browse files, edit component, save

### Phase 2b: NixOS Chromium App-Mode ✅

Package Studio as a NixOS-native app using Chromium `--app` mode:

- [x] Implement `chromium/index.ts` launcher (project server + Chromium `--app`)
- [x] Wayland support via `--ozone-platform=wayland` auto-detection
- [x] Sandboxed `nix build` via bun2nix (no `__noChroot`, no network at build time)
- [x] `makeWrapper` producing `jx-studio` binary with bundled Chromium and Bun
- [x] Auto-refresh `bun.nix` via postinstall hook
- [x] Its own PAL adapter over `createProjectServer`, not the dev-server adapter (§9.1)
- [x] Multi-window through the cross-process window registry (§9.4)
- [x] Live sidebar sync and `View: Open in Browser`, over the server-to-client push channel (§9.1)
- [x] About-screen build info via `appInfo`, with no update status it cannot verify (§9.5)

### Phase 3: Feature Parity

Ensure desktop app matches dev-mode capabilities:

- [x] Live preview at real routes with hot reload, on an origin per project (specs/server.md §3.4)
- [ ] `$prototype`/`$src` resolution via Bun process imports
- [ ] `timing: "server"` function execution
- [x] Build / SSG pipeline accessible from Studio, as its own `Build Site` command (specs/studio.md §10.2)
- [ ] Drag-and-drop component insertion from sidebar

### Phase 4: Cloud Adapter ✅

- [x] Define cloud API specification (REST endpoints mirroring PAL) — `@jxsuite/protocol`'s route table, one contract for every adapter rather than a cloud-specific one
- [x] Implement `CloudPlatform` adapter — `packages/studio/src/platforms/cloud.ts`
- [x] Project authentication and authorization — GitHub OAuth, cookie-bound sessions per `owner/repo@branch`
- [x] Real-time collaboration via WebSocket change feed — a CRDT rather than a change feed; see §10.3

## 12. Standards Alignment

External standards this specification binds itself to. Vocabulary and cell grammar: [`standards.md`](./standards.md). ElectroBun and Chromium are implementations rather than standards, so §7–§9 cite nothing.

The browser Studio keeps the device flow, because a page has no loopback server to redirect to.                                                                                |

## Changelog

- **0.4.14-draft** (2026-09-12) — §7.1 webview box names @jxsuite/ui in place of Lit + Spectrum.
- **0.4.13-draft** (2026-09-02) — Only authored sizes are emitted: a block-level box in normal flow drops the width and height a browser measured, so an imported layout stays fluid instead of pinned to the capture viewport.
- **0.4.12-draft** (2026-09-02) — A control that declares which panel it expands becomes a native disclosure, with the flow deciding whether a pair is a details element or a popover.
- **0.4.11-draft** (2026-09-02) — Import pairs a control with the panel it opens from the accessibility contract a site already ships, and emits a popover whose closed state lives in :popover-open rather than the base rule.
- **0.4.10-draft** (2026-09-01) — Import emits one file per image family, rewrites readable interactions to native markup, and samples each breakpoint twice so responsive styles carry declared values rather than measured ones.
- **0.4.9-draft** (2026-08-31) — The PAL member table names listExtensionCatalog, the extension catalogue a backend answers for itself (extensions.md §9.2).
- **0.4.8-draft** (2026-08-28) — Distinguish the window's own icon (favicon-driven, studio.md 11.2) from the taskbar/dock icon (StartupWMClass) in section 9.3.
- **0.4.7-draft** (2026-08-27) — The files route answers in stable path order, in every backend.
- **0.4.6-draft** (2026-08-27) — The PAL is project-relative in both directions; an adapter translates a request space or a reply space, never both.
- **0.4.5-draft** (2026-08-27) — Both launchers preview the working tree live at real routes; Build Site keeps the compiler, and leaving the webview is stated to be one-way.
- **0.4.4-draft** (2026-08-26) — the Import tab chooses how many breakpoints the project keeps, and what an import emits is normative (§4.5).
- **0.4.3-draft** (2026-08-26) — Typechecking resolves the ElectroBun SDK from the pinned vendor/electrobun submodule; .hutch/devkit stays the build sysroot.
- **0.4.2-draft** (2026-08-26) — Packages capability row: the registry seam is `packageVersions?` (each dependency's own latest), not `outdatedPackages?`.
- **0.4.1-draft** (2026-08-26) — the Import source hands its brief to the assistant, which runs the import; the git-init obligation moves to whatever creates the project (§4.5).
- **0.4.0-draft** (2026-08-25) — StudioPlatform writes user settings as patches (set/remove) rather than replacing the whole map, so one window cannot clear another's; and §3.6 states which store a credential belongs in.
- **0.3.24-draft** (2026-08-25) — §3.1: a platform declares assetSpace beside documentBaseUrl; §10.2 (Pending → Partial): what a storage backend must declare, including that stored bytes come back losslessly.
- **0.3.23-draft** (2026-08-25) — 10.1 removes discoverComponents from the cloud adapter's omissions: deriving component metadata from a JSON document executes nothing, and returning an empty registry left the canvas unable to register or fetch any component at all.
- **0.3.22-draft** (2026-08-24) — §7 records the ElectroBun 2 toolchain boundary: the electrobun npm devDependency selects Hutch, Cottontail and ElectroBun together (no machine-wide install and no release pin in hutch.config.ts), the SDK is projected into .hutch/devkit, the main process is pinned to bun explicitly, and stable installers drop the channel prefix that the updater feed keeps.
- **0.3.21-draft** (2026-08-24) — 3.1 states that documentBaseUrl may be absolute or root-relative, and that a root-relative value is resolved against the canvas origin because the canvas composes it as new URL(path, base) — a relative base throws and fails the whole canvas mount.
- **0.3.20-draft** (2026-08-23) — 3.1 adds the Canvas member family and states that the canvas needs project files at a URL rather than behind readFile: documentBaseUrl defaults to the canvas origin plus projectRoot and must be set by a platform whose root is an identifier rather than a served path.
- **0.3.19-draft** (2026-08-22) — 10 SaaS/Cloud is Partial rather than Future: the adapter shipped and is deployed (10.1 Implemented, with what it implements and what it deliberately omits), collaboration shipped as a CRDT rather than the sketched lock model (10.3), and 10.2's storage table is marked Pending because the deployed backend is git-backed.
- **0.3.18-draft** (2026-08-22) — 3.3 the init bundle loads through a declared boot slot rather than an exact-string replace on the shipped document.
- **0.3.17-draft** (2026-08-22) — §9.2: the session watches a project or nothing — a root with no project.json is declined rather than scanned recursively.
- **0.3.16-draft** (2026-08-22) — §9.2: the launcher adopts its working directory as a project root only when that directory holds a project.json — a named root is still taken at its word.
- **0.3.15-draft** (2026-08-21) — §9.3: released builds are published to jxsuite.cachix.org and the flake names it, so a consumer substitutes jx-studio instead of building it; verify-cache proves that after each release. The release also builds aarch64-linux as an advisory leg beside the x86_64 gate, and nix.yml runs on pushes to main so pull requests inherit a warm Actions cache for the npm tarball derivations cache.nixos.org cannot serve.
- **0.3.14-draft** (2026-08-20) — §9.3: the desktop entry ships under a stable id and claims the app_id Chromium actually gives an --app window, so the taskbar/dock can resolve the brand icon.
- **0.3.13-draft** (2026-08-20) — Chromium launcher reaches PAL parity: its own adapter over createProjectServer (§9.1), multi-window through a cross-process window registry (§9.4), a server-to-client push channel behind live sidebar sync and focus, buildSite behind View: Open in Browser, appInfo for the About screen, and an OS-opener fallback so preview links and sign-in leave the app at all (§3.5, §9.5). New Window becomes the `view.newWindow` command rather than a native-menu-only item, and the native menu drops its duplicate accelerators (§4.2a).
- **0.3.12-draft** (2026-08-19) — §9.3 documents the release branch as the ref a Nix consumer pins, and the nix build that gates it; corrects the install phase, which has used cp -r plus a dangling-symlink prune and src/chromium/index.ts since before this text was written.
- **0.3.11-draft** (2026-08-16) — §3.6 the desktop signs in with an RFC 8252 loopback redirect and PKCE; the token rests in a 0600 credential store, not localStorage. RFC 8414 and RFC 7519 recorded Rejected as vacuous. Closes gap:native-oauth and gap:oauth-pkce.
- **0.3.10-draft** (2026-08-16) — §5 the contract's failure half is specified — one RFC 9457 registry; gap:backend-failure-contract closed.
- **0.3.9-draft** (2026-08-15) — Add §12 Standards Alignment; §5 marked Partial — the Backend API Contract specifies no failure shape.
- **0.3.8-draft** (2026-08-13) — Open Project asks where a project should open (§4.2a): New Window is routed through pickProject + openProjectInNewWindow, and the outcome is reported rather than the target.
- **0.3.7-draft** (2026-08-11) — Name the pane context bar's resolving-with popover rather than the tab bar, which P8 deleted.
- **0.3.6-draft** (2026-08-03) — §3.1/§5.1: findReferences? PAL member and the GET /__studio/references route — the read side of the rename refactor's walker.
- **0.3.5-draft** (2026-08-02) — searchFiles, gitShow and openExternal RPC handlers registered on both launchers; styles/ staged into the packaged app.
- **0.3.4-draft** (2026-07-31) — List the cfConnect? PAL member in the Publish/identity family — it ships in StudioPlatform and backs the hosted Cloudflare OAuth flow, but the table omitted it.
- **0.3.3-draft** (2026-07-29) — PAL: launcher-only capabilities (updater, windowControls) stay off the StudioPlatform interface; adapter factories infer their return type and assert conformance instead of annotating it away.
- **0.3.2-draft** (2026-07-29) — The desktop shell routes Studio preview links to the user's default browser via Utils.openExternal (§3.5).
