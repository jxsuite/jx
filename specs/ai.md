**Status:** Partial\
**Updated:** 2026-09-13\
**License:** MIT

---

> **Status: Partial.** This is a stub spec for a shipped subsystem that grew ahead of its specification. It records the contract as implemented today; sections will be expanded as the subsystem stabilizes. The authoritative user documentation is [`docs/studio/ai.md`](../docs/studio/ai.md).

## 1. Overview

`@jxsuite/ai` is the assistant that edits a Jx project from natural-language instructions inside Studio. It generates and edits pages and components on the canvas while the user watches. It ships **no account and no hosted model**: the user connects their own provider, and Studio talks to it through the dev/desktop server's AI proxy (`/__studio/ai/*`, see `@jxsuite/server` §4). The package itself (`@jxsuite/ai`) has no Jx dependencies — it is a provider-agnostic streaming tool-call client built on `@vue/reactivity`.

## 2. Provider Contract

- The client speaks the **OpenAI chat-completions** wire format (streaming SSE, tool calls).
- A **user-supplied key and base URL** are required; the server proxy attaches them per request and never persists them. The proxy refuses to forward a server-environment key to a user-supplied base URL, and blocks cloud-metadata/link-local hosts (see `@jxsuite/server` §4.2).
- Local and self-hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoints (e.g. LM Studio, Ollama's OpenAI shim) are supported by pointing the base URL at them.
- A **managed** platform may broker credentials instead, so a user-supplied key is required only where nothing else supplies one (§2.1).

### 2.1 Managed providers

> **Status: Implemented.** Jx Cloud brokers Cloudflare Workers AI on the user's own Cloudflare account (`packages/studio/src/ui/ai-managed-connect.ts`, jx-platform `/api/v1/ai/*`).

A platform that can obtain credentials on the user's behalf declares it, and Studio offers that path **before** the key form rather than beside it: on such a platform, connecting an account is the recommended route and bring-your-own-key remains available beneath it.

The models endpoint is a **capability probe**, not merely a listing. Studio decides which paths to offer from its answer, so:

- It **MUST** answer `200` for every credential state, including "no credentials" and "credentials lapsed". A non-2xx makes the probe throw, and a client that cannot read the probe falls back to offering the key form alone — which withdraws the connect affordance from precisely the users who need it.
- `managed: true` declares that the backend can obtain credentials itself. `configured` reports whether it currently holds working ones.
- `code` explains a `configured: false`, and distinguishes the two states that need different words on screen: `cf_not_connected` (never connected — invite) and `cf_reconnect_required` (the grant lapsed — explain, and offer reconnection).
- `cf_upstream_error` is reported **with `configured: true`**. A provider that is briefly unreachable is not a credential problem, and prompting for re-authorization would send the user through a flow that cannot fix it.

Brokered credentials are the platform's to hold and refresh; the client never sees them. A backend that cannot refresh a lapsed grant **MUST** report `cf_reconnect_required` rather than continuing to present the expired credential to the provider.

**A row that exists is not a connection that works.** Two of the three managed states are a stored grant, and a client **MUST** distinguish them before calling a connect flow finished. A flow that settles on "is there a connection" is answered yes from the moment it starts, so it closes the provider's authorization window before the user has reached the login screen — the authorization can then never complete, and the lapsed state that needs re-authorization is precisely the state that prevents it. The proof a flow succeeded is the lapsed marker CLEARING, never the row's presence.

**`cf_account_required` is not `cf_not_connected`.** It reports a live grant with no account chosen, because the callback found more than one and could not choose for the user. Re-authorizing cannot fix it — the flow lands back in the same state — so the client owes the user a choice over the accounts endpoint instead of an invitation to connect something that already is.

**A capability probe expires with the grant it described.** A client **MUST** drop a settled probe when a send fails with `cf_reconnect_required`. A probe taken once at start-up otherwise keeps reporting a grant that lapsed mid-session, and every gate reading it keeps offering an assistant that cannot answer.

**Per-model capability facts travel with the listing.** `toolSupport` reports whether a model can make tool calls; `contextWindow` reports its usable budget in tokens. Both are optional — a bring-your-own-key provider need not report either — but a client that drops them on ingest cannot recover them later:

- A client that will send tools **SHOULD** warn when the chosen model reports `toolSupport: false`. Such a model answers and never edits, which reads as an assistant that has silently stopped working rather than one that was never able to act.
- A client **SHOULD** prefer a reported `contextWindow` over any local heuristic. A model-id prefix table only recognizes the families its author knew, so a brokered catalogue of unfamiliar ids is budgeted at the default — an amply-sized model trimmed to a fraction of its real window.

### 2.2 The request is the history the provider will accept

> **Status: Implemented.** `toMessagesArray` in `packages/ai/src/chat-state.ts`; the `reasoning` frame in `packages/ai/src/streaming-client.ts` and `packages/server/src/ai-api.ts`.

The conversation Studio displays and the array it puts on the wire are not the same object, and two of the differences are contractual rather than cosmetic:

- **An assistant turn carrying neither text nor tool calls MUST NOT be sent.** The store appends an empty assistant message the moment a turn begins, so that message is the answer being generated _by the request that would carry it_ — a turn which has not happened yet. Most providers read the trailing `{"role":"assistant","content":""}` as an empty prefill and ignore it; DeepSeek's thinking mode instead answers `400 The reasoning_content in the thinking mode must be passed back to the API`, because a thinking-mode assistant turn owes it one. That failed the FIRST request of every conversation, before any history existed to be malformed.
- **A turn's reasoning MUST be replayed when the provider streamed one.** Thinking models emit a chain-of-thought beside the answer (`reasoning_content`, or `reasoning` at OpenRouter). DeepSeek requires the reasoning of all previous turns back on any request carrying `tools` — which is every request the agent loop makes, including turns that called no tool — and ignores the field on requests carrying none. So a client MUST keep it on the message, persist it with the session, and echo it back; a provider that never sends one is never sent one, which is what makes replaying it safe everywhere.

Both halves are one rule: **what the provider streamed is what it is owed back, and nothing else.** A normalizing proxy is therefore not free to drop the frames it cannot render — `reasoning` is a member of the `StreamEvent` union precisely so a backend that only understands `delta` cannot silently strip the turn's other half and leave the next round unanswerable.

> **Status: Partial.** The **Anthropic provider is not yet implemented** (planned). Its client **yields** a single `error` event carrying `code: "NOT_IMPLEMENTED"` and a "use OpenAI" message — it does not throw, so a caller that wraps `streamChat` in `try`/`catch` never sees it (`packages/ai/src/streaming-client.ts`). That frame carries no `problem`, so a conforming reader must tolerate an `error` event without an RFC 9457 document. Only the OpenAI-compatible path ships.

## 3. Tool Surface

The assistant is given a fixed set of document-editing tools (create/edit page and component, inspect the tree, apply edits the canvas renders live). The tool schemas and the edit-application path live in `packages/ai/src`. This section is a placeholder; the concrete tool list will be enumerated here once it stabilizes.

### 3.0 The assistant is addressable by name

Every capability the chat surface offers is a command record in the `Assistant` category — Focus Composer (`⌘⇧A`), New Chat, Chat History, Retry, Attach Selection and Stop — so each one is in the palette, in the generated keyboard sheet, and rebindable, and the chat header's buttons RUN those records rather than calling module functions beside them. They are `level: "application"`, including Attach Selection: it READS the selection and WRITES a chip into the composer, and a record is filed by the level of the state it writes.

Two context keys gate them and had no readers before: `ai.configured` (a provider is connected) and `ai.streaming` (a turn is in flight, which is the only state in which Stop can act). None carries an `aiTool` projection — the assistant does not get to end its own conversation.

### 3.1 Schema gate

Every tool that produces a document or `project.json` is gated on JSON-Schema validation, and failures are returned to the model as tool errors so the agent loop self-corrects. Canvas mutations validate AFTER applying (undo is the backstop, and only NEWLY introduced errors are reported); disk writes validate BEFORE writing, because a disk write has no undo. `project.json` is gated against the project entry document, not the document one.

The gate uses the ACTIVE project's generated entry documents — the same payload and the same single fetch that drives the editor's diagnostics (studio.md §4.2.1), falling back to the bundled core schemas. Validating the loop against core alone under-checks it: the entry documents are what close the composition (`unevaluatedProperties: false`) and union in each enabled extension's shapes, so a model can otherwise ship an extension section its own tool call called clean and the editor flags the moment a human opens the file. The document-path convention the gate covers (`pages|layouts|components|elements`) tracks the editor's fileMatch globs for the same reason.

### 3.2 The turn is accountable

An assistant that edits documents must be able to say what it changed, and the author must be able to take it back. Three properties are normative.

**Every write is recorded, with whether it reached disk.** A tool that mutates the open document goes through the transaction path and is therefore reachable by undo; a tool that writes a file directly is not. That difference is a **fact recorded per write**, not a caveat in the system prompt, and the turn's summary states it: _"Changed 2 files · 1 written to disk — undo cannot reach it."_ **Restore to here** is offered only when every recorded change was transactional, and it re-checks at the moment it is clicked, because the ledger is bounded and may have been trimmed.

**A tool chip states its outcome, not just its name.** The loop already had each call's result; the renderer discarded it. A chip that cannot fail looks identical to one that did.

**Partial success is not failure.** Exhausting the tool-call budget after applying changes ends the turn with an ordinary message describing what was applied. Rendering it as an error is wrong twice over: it misreports the turn, and the error path _deletes the streaming message_, destroying the only account of the edits that did land.

### 3.3 The batch follows the document, not the tab

A multi-tool turn may move between documents. The undo batch and the collaboration publish must be re-anchored to the document each tool actually wrote — anchoring once, to whichever tab happened to be active when the turn opened, silently files one document's edits under another's history.

### 3.4 A turn may stop and ask

An assistant that must guess, or apologise for not knowing, is worse than one that can ask. `ask_user` suspends the turn on the author and resumes with their reply. Five properties are normative.

**The mechanism is the tool, not a new state.** The agent loop awaits each tool call, so a tool that returns a pending promise suspends the turn; nothing in the chat state or the streaming protocol changes. `finishStream` has already run by the time tools execute, so a suspended turn is idle by construction — "waiting" is the presence of an outstanding question, not a fourth status.

**A skip is a success, and only a stopped turn is a failure.** "You decide" is a real answer to a fair question. Reporting it as an error would have the model apologise for asking, and would end the turn on the error path — which deletes the streaming message (§3.2).

**The answer is a tool result, never a user message.** The wire format requires a `tool` reply to follow its `tool_calls` request; a user turn spliced between them is rejected. The reply is rendered into the question's own chip, so the exchange has one account in the transcript rather than two that can disagree.

**An interactive round does not spend the tool-call budget.** The round cap bounds AUTONOMOUS work, and a round that ends by blocking on a person cannot advance without them — which is the property the cap was ever a proxy for. A separate hard ceiling keeps the loop terminating regardless.

**A question does not survive a reload, and does not pretend to.** The promise is in memory and the transcript is not, so a restored question renders inert and says why. The same reload — and ordinary history truncation, and a turn stopped mid-tool — can separate a `tool_calls` request from its reply, so the send path repairs the pairing: a request with no reply is sealed with a synthesised failure, and a reply with no request is dropped.

**What may be asked is bounded.** A question the model could have answered with another tool is waste, and a question about an option the answer cannot reach is worse than waste, because the reply cannot be honoured. Both are stated in the prompt as prohibitions.

### 3.5 Bootstrapping by import

`import_site` is `create_project`'s sibling: it clones a live site into a new project and adopts it into the window. Five properties are normative.

**Availability is a tier AND a capability.** "No project is open" is exactly as true on a backend with no import pipeline as on one with it, so a tier alone cannot express this; the tool declares the PAL member it needs, and one predicate answers for both the prompt's tool list and the execution gate. A tool the model is told about and then refused is a surprise to it; one refused without being told is invisible.

**The destination is the author's, not the model's.** When the run was started from the New Project wizard, the destination has already been chosen in front of the user, with a folder picker and a live preview. The tool takes it from there; a model-supplied path that disagrees is refused by name rather than silently preferred either way.

**Every create path initialises a repository.** The obligation in `specs/desktop.md` §4.5 is the create path's, not the wizard's — it belongs with whatever creates the project, and both bootstrap tools go through the same adoption sequence: version control, then the open flow, then a check that the workspace really moved. The adopter reports its failures rather than raising them, so a resolved promise is not proof.

**The project opens when it EXISTS, not when the run ends.** A crawl takes minutes, and adopting on the terminal line spent all of them with the author on the welcome screen — the only account of what was happening was a log in the sidebar. The pipeline announces the destination as soon as it holds an openable `project.json` (`specs/server.md`'s `ready` line), and adoption happens there, so pages, components and assets arrive in a file tree somebody is watching. Adoption runs at most once: a second one at the end would replace every tab the author opened while the crawl ran. A backend that sends no such signal is not broken — it is older — and the project opens at the end as before.

**The pipeline reports; the agent asks.** The import stream is one-way, so nothing pauses mid-crawl. What the run found — pages skipped by robots or by the node cap, the layout it did not detect, the components it may have split wrongly, per-page render fidelity — travels on the terminal line and becomes the material for §3.4, against real numbers rather than a guess made before the browser launched. The run's own account of itself outlives it: the transcript keeps the whole log under the tool call that produced it, scrollable and collapsed once the run is over, rather than showing a fixed tail of it and discarding the record on success.

### 3.6 Command tools

The assistant's tools are two kinds, and the difference is who wrote the tool.

**Hand tools** are registered in `packages/studio/src/services/ai-*.ts` and gated by tier: `AI_TOOL_TIERS` in `ai-system-prompt.ts` is the one table of them, carrying each tool's tier (`always`, `no-project`, `project`, `document`, `document-tree`) and its prompt blurb, and `document-assistant.ts` derives the gating predicates from the same rows. They exist for a write no person-verb makes: the seven tree writers address a node by path (the Inspector's job, not a command's), the file tools write arbitrary paths wholesale (`studio.md` §13.5's Remote Rule), and `create_project` / `import_site` re-key the conversation as a side effect a command must not know about. `ask_user` is a loop primitive, ungated.

**Command tools** are the command records that declare `aiTool` (`studio.md` §13.1), projected by `services/ai-command-tools.ts` as a view over the window's registry. Nothing registers them: each record IS its tool, `execute` is `registry.run`, `parameters` is the record's `args`, the gate is the record's own `when` / `enablement`, and `report` is what the model reads afterwards. The bridge's only additions are the write witness for `undo: "document"` records — an unchanged document root after `run` is "changed nothing", never success — the ledger entry `undo` implies, and the schema verdict every document write already gets (`ai-write-report.ts`: new schema errors with fix hints, the render check, the token hints). The ledger's default is what the record writes, so an idempotent run that found its state already so answers `wrote: []` and files nothing (`enable_extension` on an enabled package, `add_project_locale` on a declared tag). A `report` that throws after `run` resolved is answered as a failure that says the run happened, with the ledger filed from the record's defaults — the write must not vanish behind the sentence about it. A selection-level record takes `paths` and is run as `selection.setPaths` then the verb, both under their own gates.

**Every projected tool is `strict: false`, deliberately.** `@jxsuite/ai`'s registry validator never checks `enum` and treats a required `null` as missing, which would refuse `select_node { path: null }` — a legal call. The registry's coercion (`coerceArgs`, applied inside `registry.run` for every caller) is the single validator, and its `RangeError` sentence is what the model reads.

**The loop sees one registry**, `composeToolRegistries(hand, commands)`: the hand side gated by tier, the command side gated by the record, listed hand-first, routed by name, with an unknown name answered as `@jxsuite/ai` answers it. The two name sets are disjoint and their sum is the composite's length, asserted with counts, because `ToolRegistry.register` only warns on a duplicate name. The prompt's tool list is the same two filters — `toolActive` for the hand rows and `advertisedCommandTools` for the records — so it advertises exactly what the gate will honour.

## 4. Security & Trust

The assistant executes only through the same file/RPC surfaces a human uses, behind the server's Origin/Host gate and path containment (`@jxsuite/server` §4.2). It has no independent network or filesystem access beyond the connected provider endpoint.

## 5. Standards Alignment

External standards this specification binds itself to. Vocabulary and cell grammar: [`standards.md`](./standards.md). The provider wire format is OpenAI's chat-completions API, which is a vendor de-facto format rather than a published standard, so it is described in §2 rather than cited here.

| Standard                                                                                                  | Class      | Binds | Evidence                                                           | Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
